# ESP32-C6 radio electrical interface

Design record for issue #826 and schematic `radio_esp32.kicad_sch`.
The retained module candidate is ESP32-C6-WROOM-1-N8. This record is an
interface design basis, not a completed circuit or demonstrated RA8P1 port.

Current host allocation, 2026-09-13: [CMS-016](camera_storage_interfaces.md#cms-016-two-camera-expansion-and-lighting-requirements)
supersedes the SPIA_C host pin allocation below. The native MCU bus now
uses SCI0 SCLK P601/P4, CIPO P602/P2, COPI P603/P1 and GPIO CS_N
P604/N2. The radio-side U5 pins and all other net memberships are retained.
P700..P702 are freed for SSI1_B audio and P703 for CEU D7, neither yet
placed. SPIA timing calculations below are historical for that transport;
SCI timing, DMA/cache behavior and hardware qualification remain open.
The current full-project native/CLI ERC is 121 errors and two warnings,
including the freed B14 input awaiting CEU after the volume-up migration;
older
reset/switch-stage ERC and export counts below describe those checkpoints.

Current reset migration, 2026-09-08: [RST-002](reset_coordination_tps3890.md)
supersedes the former U2 fixed-supervisor and RADIO-014 divider selections.
U2 TPS389001DSET is now wired with R67/R74 33k/20k, R75 10k MR pull-up
and C95 10n CT; the targeted U2 netlist check is complete. Native/CLI ERC
remains 139 errors and two warnings with no U2 violations and no changed
rules/exclusions; BOM/PDF and the MCU/radio notes are refreshed. This is
not independent whole-circuit validation. Native radio R12/R13
now use ERA-6ARW333V 33k / RG1608N-203-W-T1 20k. U6 and U7 MR
arbitration are retained. U4 is now TPS22964CYZPT with R7 4.7k/R8 10k;
C48 and the former external CT/QOD branches are removed. The 2026-09-12
working XML export confirms all six U4 balls and its ON partition under
[RADIO-019](#radio-019-tps22964c-low-loss-switch-migration).
Native and CLI ERC preserve exactly all 141 baseline findings (139 errors,
two warnings), with all four ignored checks unchanged. The full 12-page PDF
was visually reviewed; after the later page-9 wording correction, the full
PDF was re-exported and final page-9 render review passed. Native BOM
export has 19 columns/84 groups: all 210 included references, values and
MPNs match the XML, with no duplicates and only TP1-TP3 excluded. These
checks do not qualify hardware.
RST-002's 18.540692 mV radio release margin remains conditional on a
qualified 20 mV complete path loss, not guaranteed by the IC substitution.
The former TPS22917 87.5 mV loss and -48.959308 mV release screens remain
historical evidence. TPS22997 is not adopted. No fast-collapse closure is
claimed. RADIO-004/006/007 and the TPS22917 capacitor/control portions of
RADIO-009/016 preserve historical proofs, not the current switch circuit.

## RADIO-001: host transport

ESP-Hosted supports a full-duplex SPI coprocessor connection on ESP32-C6.
It requires SCLK, COPI, CIPO, CS, reset, handshake and data-ready. Both
handshake and data-ready need interrupt-capable host inputs. A four-wire
SPI connection alone is insufficient. A non-Espressif host needs a software
port; protocol availability does not prove an existing RA8P1 implementation.

The documented default C6 coprocessor mapping is:

| Signal | C6 GPIO | Module contact | Direction relative to RA8P1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RADIO_SCLK | 6 | 6 | Output |
| RADIO_COPI | 7 | 7 | Output |
| RADIO_CIPO | 2 | 27 | Input |
| RADIO_CS_N | 10 | 11 | Output |
| RADIO_HANDSHAKE | 3 | 26 | Input, interrupt |
| RADIO_DATA_READY | 4 | 4 | Input, interrupt |
| RADIO_EN | EN | 3 | Reset control through U6; DC coordination unresolved |

Full-duplex SPI is the selected schematic transport. GPIO4 is
also a strap and must not be loaded by a host pull during strap sampling.
GPIO6/7 also have JTAG functions. Keep recovery programming separate from
these reused signals. SDIO is not connected in this design. Do not label SPI
frequency as achieved throughput: framing, handshakes and firmware reduce it.

Source: [Espressif Hosted full-duplex SPI guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/esp-hosted-mcu/main/docs/spi_full_duplex.md),
sections 3.1 and 5, read 2026-09-05. Pin defaults are configurable and must
be frozen with the coprocessor firmware configuration before release.

### RADIO-008: RA8P1 host allocation

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to U1E on the MCU I/O sheet. The selected
host peripheral is SPIA, using its C pin mapping. Authority:
[RA8P1 datasheet R01DS0439EJ0130](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/dst/ra8p1-group-datasheet),
Table 1.17, standard-product BGA289 column, pages 28-30. Do not use the
303-ball table or the alternate 224-ball column: their contact assignments
are different. All eight port names and ball numbers below were checked
against the project symbol before wiring the hierarchical labels.

| MCU boundary net | U1 ball | Port / selected function | MCU sheet direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RADIO_CIPO | F12 | P700 / MISOA_C | Input |
| RADIO_COPI | F15 | P701 / MOSIA_C | Output |
| RADIO_SCLK | F13 | P702 / RSPCKA_C | Output |
| RADIO_CS_N | G14 | P703 / SSLA0_C | Output |
| RADIO_DATA_READY | G13 | P704 / IRQ26 | Input |
| RADIO_HANDSHAKE | F17 | P705 / IRQ19 | Input |
| RADIO_RESET_REQ_N | E17 | P706 / GPIO, active-low request | Output |
| RADIO_PWR_EN | F16 | P707 / GPIO, active-high request | Output |

These are host-side signals in the MCU supply domain, not permission to
short host and switched-radio domains together. RESET_REQ_N is a request
to U7 reset arbitration; it is not a direct EN connection.
The parent sheet connects P707 to R7 through RADIO_PWR_EN. The other seven
parent-sheet connections and radio-domain isolation remain incomplete.
The generic multi-function GPIO symbol pins still use the imported passive
ERC type; hierarchical directions do not replace final pin-type review.

This allocation consumes neither SDRAM/ExBus signals nor OSPI signals in
Table 1.17. It leaves SPIB for other peripherals and preserves the P100-P104
OSPI0 group. It excludes Ethernet on these pins, SD1 eight-bit data pins
4-7 in mapping B, and the overlapping parallel camera functions. P706/P707
cannot also serve USBHS overcurrent inputs; the planned USB device/charging
interface must not silently repurpose them for USB host mode. P703's IRQ19
alternate is disabled: IRQ19 belongs to P705 only. IRQ26 and IRQ19 are
ordinary interrupt inputs, not a claim of deep-standby wake capability.

Firmware must implement the non-Espressif ESP-Hosted port, configure the
selected SPIA mux and two distinct IRQ inputs, and keep CS inactive between
transfers. A host transaction requires HANDSHAKE asserted; DATA_READY alone
is not readiness. Start evaluation at 5 MHz per the Espressif guide, then
qualify timing through the selected isolation components before increasing
speed. At 5 MHz, a 1600-byte transfer takes at least 1600*8/5e6 = 2.56 ms;
the per-direction raw ceiling is 5e6/8 = 625000 bytes/s. Protocol overhead,
software scheduling and handshake gaps reduce payload throughput. This is
not a demonstrated throughput figure or a completed application budget.

Reproduce this arithmetic (no schematic changes):

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
clock_hz = 5000000
frame_bytes = 1600
assert F(frame_bytes*8, clock_hz) == F('0.00256')
assert F(clock_hz, 8) == 625000
print('RADIO-008 PASS: 2.56 ms/frame and 625000 bytes/s raw; not measured throughput.')
PY
```

Boot and power controls must establish safe hardware defaults before the
MCU firmware runs. In particular, disable MCU pull-ups on the enable divider
and on C6 strap-related paths. Signal isolation, power-good qualification,
reset hold and recovery access remain required under RADIO-002 and #825/#826.

## RADIO-002: module pin and boot constraints

Authority: [Espressif module datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf),
ESP32-C6-WROOM-1 / WROOM-1U v1.4, Tables 3-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-8 and 6-2.

- Supply contact 2: 3.0..3.6 V; external supply capability at least 0.5 A.
  This is a supply-capability requirement, not a constant consumption claim.
- Ground contacts: 1, 28 and exposed pad 29. Contact 22 is NC.
- EN must not float. Supply stabilization before EN rises and reset-low
  duration each require at least 50 us. Strap hold time after EN rises is
  at least 3 ms.
- Normal flash boot requires GPIO9 high. Joint download requires GPIO8
  high and GPIO9 low. Provide deterministic strap levels and recovery access.
- UART0 RX/TX are contacts 24/25. GPIO12/13 are USB D-/D+ on contacts
  13/14. Select the recovery interface explicitly; neither is automatically
  safe to connect to an independently powered programming adapter.

The imported local symbol numbered exposed-pad subdivisions `29_1`,
`29_2`, etc. These were not distinct manufacturer electrical pins. The
project-local symbol was corrected through KiCad to one EPAD pin 29,
with the eight redundant entries removed. All contacts 1..29 are present
once and the GPIO/control mapping was checked against Table 3-1. The
power-unit outline was reduced to fit its four remaining pins. U3A/U3B
are placed on the radio sheet; grounds and manufacturer-NC connections are
captured. Contact 2 and C45's upper terminal connect to +3V3_RADIO;
C45's lower terminal connects to GND, verified in the saved netlist.
C45 reuses TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA (100 nF, 50 V, X7R, +/-10%) and
its existing sourced BOM metadata. This local bypass does not replace bulk
capacitance, supply transient analysis, or the required source circuitry.
C46 adds a 10 uF nominal bulk capacitor across the same rail and ground;
its bias calculation is RADIO-003 below. The host interface and remaining
support circuit are still open.
Physical pad segmentation and footprint mapping require the separate
deferred PCB review; the existing imported footprint is not qualified by
this electrical correction.

## Power-domain integration

The module rail is named +3V3_RADIO; U4 provides its load-switch source.
The upstream TPS63806 is implemented under PWR-006; regulator qualification
and the complete enable/control policy remain open.
No PWR_FLAG declares the unfinished upstream supply driven. Every
host-driven signal, pull-up, recovery signal and interrupt return must be
reviewed for both host-off/radio-on and host-on/radio-off states. Firmware
high-impedance configuration alone is not a guaranteed power-off isolation
mechanism. Select isolation with specified partial-power-down behavior if
the rails can be independently switched. Account for its propagation delay,
leakage, default output-enable state and loading in the final timing budget.

The module's antenna and 40 MHz oscillator are integrated. Do not add a
second external main oscillator or discrete RF matching network to its
digital carrier schematic. Mechanical antenna clearance remains a later
integration constraint, not a justification for arbitrary footprint changes.

## RADIO-003: bulk capacitance

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to C46 on the
[radio schematic](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch), whose RADIO-003 note
links to this section. The exact part is TDK C3216X7R1V106K160AC,
10 uF nominal, +/-10%, 35 V, X7R. This reuses the sourced part fitted at
C43, not the USB circuit's selection rationale. C45 supplies the parallel
100 nF local bypass. Both capacitors connect between +3V3_RADIO and GND.

The [TDK exact-part record](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C3216X7R1V106K160AC)
provides the nominal DC-bias curve retained in the
[source CSV](../resources/datasheets/TDK_C3216X7R1V106K160AC_dc_bias_2026-09-05.csv).
Its adjacent points are 9.69875 uF at 3.15 V and 9.38950 uF at 4 V.
Linear interpolation gives:

```text
C(V) = Ca + (V - Va)/(Vb - Va)*(Cb - Ca)
C(3.3 V) = 9.69875 + (3.3 - 3.15)/0.85*(9.38950 - 9.69875)
         = 9.644176470588... uF
C(3.6 V) = 9.69875 + (3.6 - 3.15)/0.85*(9.38950 - 9.69875)
         = 9.535029411764... uF
```

These values are nominal interpolation, NOT a guaranteed minimum. Initial
tolerance, temperature, aging and excitation are not included. The 35 V
rating alone does not establish effective capacitance. The module's supply
capability requirement is at least 0.5 A; this is not an assumed load-step
amplitude or proof that 10 uF is sufficient.

The [Espressif schematic checklist](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-hardware-design-guidelines/en/latest/esp32c6/schematic-checklist.html)
recommends bulk capacitance to address transmit-induced rail collapse.
Its chip-level bypass recommendations are not a replacement for the module
reference circuit or a completed carrier power-distribution analysis.
For the final regulator and load switch, evaluate the current deficit and
effective capacitance together:

```text
DeltaQ = integral(Iload(t) - Isource(t), dt)
DeltaV_capacitive = DeltaQ / C_effective
```

ESR, interconnect impedance and regulator response add further effects.
No current waveform, response interval or allowable transient budget has
yet been established for this rail, so a numerical droop sign-off would
be unsupported. The complete waveform must remain within 3.0..3.6 V at
the module supply contact. U4 now provides the load-switch output connection;
its VIN now connects to +3V3_MCU with C47 input bypass. The upstream TPS63806 is implemented under PWR-006 but remains unqualified.
R7/R8 now connect ON to RADIO-019's 4.7k/10k default-off enable divider,
but its host GPIO and timing control are not yet qualified. There is deliberately
no PWR_FLAG on this rail.

Reproduce the arithmetic from the repository root (read-only):

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'

## Module sourcing

U3's native KiCad fields identify Espressif Systems ESP32-C6-WROOM-1-N8
and [DigiKey 1965-ESP32-C6-WROOM-1-N8CT-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-C6-WROOM-1-N8/17728866).
The 2026-09-05 listing showed Active status, 1435 units in stock, and USD
5.55 / 4.80 / 4.1844 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100. A US tariff may apply.
This is a dated procurement snapshot, not a stock reservation or design
qualification. Recheck availability and total price before ordering.

## RADIO-004: radio load switch

Historical TPS22917 circuit/proof retained below. RADIO-019 records the
native TPS22964 migration, R7 4.7k and removal of C48. Do not transfer
CT/QOD or divider calculations to the new IC.

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to U4 on
[the radio sheet](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch), with the same RADIO-004
identifier on the schematic. This is a partial implementation, not electrical
release: VIN is connected to +3V3_MCU with C47 input bypass; ON has the
RADIO-006 divider and C48 connects CT to VIN. Host control requires completion
with the upstream regulator,
reset supervisor and signal isolation under issues #825 and #826.

U4 is Texas Instruments TPS22917DBVT, the active-high version. The exact
[TI datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22917.pdf),
SLVSDW8B Rev. B, December 2021, is the electrical authority. Table 6-1,
page 4, gives pins 1 VIN, 2 GND, 3 ON, 4 CT, 5 QOD and 6 VOUT.
The project-local symbol is copied through KiCad from the bundled
Power_Management:TPS22917DBV symbol, with exact ordering and sourcing fields.
Its 100 mil pins retain the compact standard-symbol geometry, as with U2;
the placed reference/value are automatically stacked above the body.
No existing footprint or PCB geometry was changed or qualified.

QOD is modeled as a passive analog discharge terminal, not a logic
open-collector output: it exposes the switched internal 150 ohm typical
discharge path and is explicitly intended to connect to VOUT. Keeping the
bundled logic-output type produces a false conflict with VOUT's power-output
type for TI's recommended direct connection. Only U4's project-local pin 5
type was corrected; no ERC matrix rule or exclusion was changed. VIN/GND
remain power inputs, VOUT a power output, ON an input and CT an output.

Native fields identify [DigiKey 296-48370-1-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TPS22917DBVT/8567084).
The listing inspected on 2026-09-05 showed Active status, 8127 units and USD
1.14 / 0.822 / 0.6554 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100. Availability is not reserved.
The DBVR listing is out of stock; do not report its DBVT substitute inventory
as DBVR inventory. TI's packaging table identifies DBVT as a 250-piece small
reel. TPS22917L is active-low and is not an interchangeable control option.

### Leakage, rail drop and protection limits

Table 7.5, page 6, specifies enabled input quiescent current of 0.5 uA
typical, 1.0 uA maximum over -40..85 C, with output open. Disabled current
for TPS22917 is 10 nA typical, 100 nA maximum over -40..85 C with VOUT at
ground. These are switch-only figures; module, supervisor, isolator and
board leakage must be added to the system sleep budget.

RON is specified at discrete VIN values, not as an all-voltage 80 mohm
maximum. At VIN=3.6 V and IOUT=200 mA it is 90 mohm typical and 140 mohm
maximum over -40..85 C; at 1.8 V the corresponding maximum is 175 mohm.
Do not interpolate these maxima into a guaranteed 3.3 V specification.
The following is an explicit screening allocation, not a guaranteed bound:

```text
Assume upstream nominal 3.3 V +/-2% and allocated switch R = 0.175 ohm.
Use I = 0.5 A as a supply-capability screening point, not a measured load.
VIN_low = 3.3*(1-0.02) = 3.234 V
Vdrop = I*R = 0.5*0.175 = 0.0875 V
VOUT_screen = 3.234-0.0875 = 3.1465 V
Headroom above module 3.0 V minimum = 0.1465 V
P_switch_screen = I^2*R = 0.5^2*0.175 = 0.04375 W
```

This headroom excludes wiring, regulator transient error and other drops.
It also did not establish reset-supervisor compatibility: the former U2
TPS3808G33 conservative release screen was 3.19395125 V (RST-001), above
this loaded rail screen by 0.04745125 V. A radio supervisor cannot simply
be copied with a claim of full-load release margin. Joint rail regulation,
load-switch loss, reset thresholds and radio load sequencing need resolution.
This is historical rail screening; the current RST-002/TPS63806 dependency
and negative radio release headroom are stated in the opening scope note.

The switch's 2 A absolute maximum is not a current-limit function. Upstream
fault protection remains necessary. Section 9.4 and Table 7.5 describe reverse
current detection with -0.5 A typical/-1 A limit and 10 us typical activation
at the stated reverse-voltage condition. Do not call this instantaneous,
zero-reverse-current isolation. It does not isolate the ESP32 GPIOs from a
powered host; separate partial-power-down signal isolation remains required.

### Output discharge calculation

U4.5 QOD connects directly to U4.6 VOUT, which supplies +3V3_RADIO.
U4.2 connects to GND. Section 9.3.3, pages 15-16, permits this direct
connection. With no added resistor, the nominal internal discharge resistance
is 150 ohm. This is a typical value, not a characterized min/max guarantee.

```text
External nominal capacitance = C45+C46 = 0.1+10 = 10.1 uF
For an unloaded ideal RC approximation:
tau = R*C = 150*10.1e-6 = 0.001515 s = 1.515 ms
t_90_to_10 = ln(0.9/0.1)*tau = ln(9)*tau = 3.328795235 ms
TI equation 4 approximation: 2.2*R*C = 3.333 ms
```

The fitted capacitors' bias/tolerance, the module's internal capacitance,
other future radio-rail parts and actual load change this result. When VIN
collapses, discharge strength also falls (section 9.3.3.1). This estimate
therefore does not set a guaranteed minimum radio-off time or prove a reset.
Power-cycle timing must wait for the complete circuit and measured discharge.

### Timing-capacitor connection and calculation authority

CT connects to VIN, NOT ground, and TI specifies a capacitor voltage rating
of at least 7 V (Table 7.3). This differs from the imported TPS22918 family.
C48 is now fitted between U4.4 and VIN. Its exact-part selection and initial
timing screen are documented in [RADIO-007](#radio-007-slew-rate-capacitor).

Datasheet equation 1 prints CT = slew/SRON, but its units are inconsistent.
Use equation 6 and the worked example on page 18:

```text
CT[pF] = SRON[(mV/us)*pF] / desired_slew[mV/us]
desired_slew = allowed_capacitive_inrush / total_output_capacitance
```

The error is identified by dimensional analysis and the manufacturer's own
worked example, not by silently changing the source. At the 3.6 V table
point SRON is 1900 (mV/us)*pF for CT >=100 pF. The initial fitted
CT=1000 pF gives a 1.9 mV/us estimate, and 10.1 uF would draw 19.19 mA
capacitive inrush. Total input current also includes the load. These timing
coefficients are typical; 3.6 V is a table point, not the selected rail value.
Finalize CT after the upstream transient budget and complete capacitance
are known, and maintain an independent power-stable reset delay. Its present
value is an initial implementation, not completed startup qualification.

### Reproducible arithmetic

Run from any directory; this verifies the stated screening arithmetic only:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from math import log, isclose

vin_low = F('3.3') * (1-F('0.02'))
current, resistance = F('0.5'), F('0.175')
drop = current * resistance
vout = vin_low-drop
assert vin_low == F('3.234') and drop == F('0.0875')
assert vout == F('3.1465') and vout-F(3) == F('0.1465')
assert current**2*resistance == F('0.04375')
release = F('3.07')*F('1.015')*F('1.025')
assert release-vout == F('0.04745125')
cap_u = F('10.1')
tau_ms = F(150)*cap_u/F(1000)
assert tau_ms == F('1.515')
exact_ms = log(9)*float(tau_ms)
assert isclose(exact_ms, 3.328795234664, abs_tol=1e-9)
assert F('2.2')*tau_ms == F('3.333')
slew = F(1900)/F(1000)
assert slew*cap_u == F('19.19')
print(f'RC 90..10% estimate: {exact_ms:.9f} ms')
print('RADIO-004 PASS: arithmetic only; rail/timing qualification open.')
PY
```

## RADIO-005: input bypass

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to C47 and U4 VIN on
[the radio sheet](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch). The schematic carries
the same RADIO-005 identifier and links back to this section.

C47 connects between +3V3_MCU and GND, directly at the U4 input network.
It uses TDK C3216X7R1V106K160AC, 10 uF nominal, +/-10%, 35 V X7R,
with the same exact ordering code and sourcing fields as C46. The
selection is initial local bypass, not completed regulator qualification.
[TI TPS22917 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22917.pdf)
section 11, page 19, recommends 1 uF in most applications and additional
bulk capacitance when the source responds slowly to load steps. It also
requires the source to withstand the transient current demand. Choosing
10 uF does not remove that requirement.

The exact-part TDK curve and reproducible interpolation in
[RADIO-003](#radio-003-bulk-capacitance) also apply to C47:

```text
C47(3.3 V) = 9.69875 + (3.3-3.15)/0.85*(9.38950-9.69875)
           = 9.644176470588... uF nominal
DeltaQ = integral(Iload(t)-Isource(t), dt)
DeltaV_capacitive = DeltaQ / C47_effective
```

The capacitance is not a guaranteed minimum; initial tolerance,
temperature, aging and excitation remain outside that curve calculation.
ESR and ESL add voltage excursions, and the shared MCU rail adds other
loads and capacitances. Do not use C47 alone to characterize the complete
input power-distribution network. No numerical transient droop is claimed
without a regulator response, load waveform and acceptable rail budget.

C47 is upstream of U4, so it is deliberately excluded from RADIO-004's
switched output-discharge capacitance C45+C46 = 10.1 uF nominal. Include
C47 in the upstream regulator's eventual startup and stability analysis.
No PWR_FLAG was added. The upstream TPS63806 is now implemented under
PWR-006; source protection and rail qualification remain open. The 10.1uF
accounting below is historical; C50 makes the current external total 10.2uF.

Run the RADIO-003 Python block to verify the shared exact-part curve.
The following additionally verifies the nominal capacitance accounting:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F

caps_u = {'C45': F('0.1'), 'C46': F(10), 'C47': F(10)}
output_refs = ('C45', 'C46')
input_refs = ('C47',)
assert set(output_refs).isdisjoint(input_refs)
assert sum(caps_u[ref] for ref in output_refs) == F('10.1')
assert sum(caps_u[ref] for ref in input_refs) == F(10)
print('RADIO-005 PASS: nominal accounting only; verify nets separately.')

```

## RADIO-006: enable divider

Historical TPS22917-specific proof. RADIO-019 records the implemented
4.7k/10k ON divider with retained R7/R8 references.

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. R7 is the series resistor from hierarchical input
RADIO_PWR_EN to U4 ON; R8 connects ON to GND. The radio sheet and its parent
have matching input pins. The parent input remains unrouted pending host
GPIO allocation; this is not a completed host interface.

Both resistors are YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, 10 kohm +/-1%, 100 mW at 70 C,
with +/-100 ppm/C temperature coefficient. Exact part and procurement fields
are retained from the already sourced MCU resistors; copied MCU pull-up
rationale is replaced with RADIO-006 rationale. Their sourcing snapshot is
dated, not a reservation. Footprints remain deferred.

### Why a divider, not just a pulldown

[TI TPS22917 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22917.pdf),
Table 7.3, requires ON <=0.35 V for low and >=1.0 V for high. The
[RA8P1 datasheet](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/dst/ra8p1-group-datasheet),
R01DS0439EJ0130 Rev.1.30, Table 2.7, page 56, specifies general output
VOL <=0.5 V at 1 mA and VOH >=VCC-0.5 V at -1 mA. Therefore a direct
connection cannot be signed off from those GPIO limits alone. The divider
attenuates the low level while retaining adequate high-level voltage.

The following calculation assumes a host supply of at least 3.0 V, hence
VOH >=2.5 V for the stated GPIO category. It is not approval of an arbitrary
GPIO or drive-strength setting. The final allocation must satisfy the exact
pin's electrical table, current limit, reset state and power-domain behavior.

### Resistance and leakage screening

Use an explicit +/-2% resistance envelope for screening. Initial +/-1% and
100 ppm/C over -40..85 C relative to 25 C give a maximum 65 C offset:

```text
Rmax_screen = 10000*1.02 = 10200 ohm
Rmin_screen = 10000*0.98 = 9800 ohm
Initial + temperature upper factor = 1.01*(1+65*100e-6) = 1.016565
Initial + temperature lower factor = 0.99*(1-65*100e-6) = 0.983565
```

Thus +/-2% covers those initial and temperature terms, but is not a full
life/aging or solder-stress guarantee. Include those effects at final review.

Allocate +/-10 uA total current injected into the ON node for screening.
This is an allocation, NOT a measured board leakage or an all-state TI limit.
TI Table 7.5 specifies +/-10 nA ON leakage in the enabled state only. The
RA8P1 Table 2.7, page 57, gives up to 5 uA three-state leakage for 5 V-tolerant
ports and 1 uA for other listed ports under its stated powered conditions.
Neither table alone establishes behavior with the host unpowered. The final
design must verify all power states and board leakage against the allocation.

For R7 series, R8 shunt, and signed injected current Ileak:

```text
VON = VGPIO * R8/(R7+R8) + Ileak * (R7*R8)/(R7+R8)
Divider fraction range = 9800/(10200+9800)..10200/(9800+10200)
                       = 0.49..0.51
Rparallel <=10200/2 = 5100 ohm
VON_low <=0.5*0.51 + 10e-6*5100 = 0.306 V
Low margin >=0.35-0.306 = 0.044 V
VON_high >=2.5*0.49 - 10e-6*5100 = 1.174 V
High margin >=1.174-1.0 = 0.174 V
Host Hi-Z: VON <=10e-6*10200 = 0.102 V
```

These are conservative separated extrema; they do not depend on pretending
all extrema occur at one resistor corner. The internal 750 kohm typical
smart pulldown is omitted from this screen. TI disconnects it after ON is
driven high, so it is not relied on to discharge a subsequently floating host
control. R8 supplies the external default-off path. Disable any host internal
pull-up: the RA8P1's up-to-300 uA pull-up would exceed the leakage allocation.

### Current, dissipation and timing

```text
At VGPIO <=3.6 V, maximum divider current without node leakage:
I <=3.6/(9800+9800) = 183.673469 uA
Conservative host-current bound including the whole leakage allocation:
Ihost <=183.673469+10 = 193.673469 uA <1 mA
Ptotal <=3.6^2/19600 = 0.661224490 mW (zero-leakage screen)
Nominal enabled current at 3.3 V = 3.3/20000 = 165 uA
```

Do not report the load switch's sub-microamp quiescent current as the whole
enabled control budget: the divider draws the current above while enabled.
The 100 mW resistor rating is ample for this screening load, subject to the
manufacturer's temperature derating and final stress review.

With the host Hi-Z and no injected leakage, ideal discharge from 1.65 V to
0.35 V is t=R8*Cnode*ln(1.65/0.35). Cnode and all-state leakage are not yet
qualified, so this does not establish a numerical reset or power-off delay.
U4 CT timing, the radio supervisor, output discharge and GPIO isolation are separate
circuits; this divider does not replace them or prevent signal back-powering.

## RADIO-007: slew-rate capacitor

Historical TPS22917-specific proof. RADIO-019 records removal of C48:
TPS22964 has internal slew control and no CT pin.

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. C48 on the radio sheet is the U4 timing capacitor,
connected between CT and VIN, not GND. Its schematic annotation links to this
section. C48 is not an output bypass capacitor and is not added to the
RADIO-004 output-discharge capacitance.

### Exact part and sourcing

C48 is [TDK C1608NP01H102J080AA](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C1608NP01H102J080AA),
1 nF +/-5%, 50 V, NP0 with 0 +/-30 ppm/C temperature characteristic.
TDK lists Production status and -55..150 C operation. This stable dielectric
is appropriate for an initial timing component; its 50 V rating exceeds
TI's 7 V minimum timing-capacitor rating in Table 7.3. Do not substitute a
6.3 V part merely because the external rail is nominally 3.3 V.

[DigiKey 445-14055-1-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tdk/C1608NP01H102J080AA/3955721)
was listed Active on 2026-09-05 with 27,277 units, 24-week standard lead
time and USD 0.22 / 0.125 / 0.078 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100. Recheck stock,
price and any tariff before ordering. These exact values are recorded in
C48's native sourcing fields. No footprint geometry was added or qualified.

### Initial timing and capacitive-inrush screen

The authority is [TI TPS22917 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22917.pdf)
SLVSDW8B Rev. B, Table 7.6, page 7, and section 10.2.2.1, page 18.
Use the consistent equation 6, CT=SRON/slew; RADIO-004 explains the
dimensionally inconsistent printed equation 1. The 1 nF initial choice slows
the output edge substantially relative to open CT while retaining a
millisecond-scale typical turn-on. It does not establish the final current
budget or reset-release delay.

At the 3.6 V table point, 25 C, using TI's typical coefficients:

```text
CT = 1 nF = 1000 pF
slew = 1900 [(mV/us)*pF] / 1000 [pF] = 1.9 mV/us = 1900 V/s
tON = 3.8 [us/pF] * 1000 [pF] = 3800 us = 3.8 ms
tR = 1.6 [us/pF] * 1000 [pF] = 1600 us = 1.6 ms
Cexternal_nominal = C45+C46 = 10.1 uF
Icapacitive = C*dV/dt = 10.1e-6*1900 = 0.01919 A = 19.19 mA
Open CT comparison: Icapacitive = 10.1e-6*44000 = 0.4444 A
```

tR is TI's 10..90% output rise-time metric; tON also includes turn-on delay.
These are separately tabulated typical metrics, not exact interchangeable
linear-ramp definitions. Table 7.6 uses CL=1 uF and RL=10 ohm unless
otherwise stated. The external 10.1 uF calculation above is a capacitor-only
estimate, not a repetition of TI's test load. Neither the 3.6 V coefficients
nor the resulting times are guaranteed at the selected 3.3 V rail.

Module internal capacitance, the reset supervisor and other future radio
components add load. Operating current adds to capacitive current. Current
drawn while the module rail ramps must be evaluated with the final EN/reset
network; 19.19 mA is not the full module startup current. U4 is not a current
limiter, and its 2 A absolute maximum must not be used as a protection setting.

### Capacitor tolerance sensitivity, not IC timing limits

For an initial -40..85 C screen, maximum offset from 25 C is 65 C:

```text
Cmin = 1000*(1-0.05)*(1-65*30e-6) = 948.1475 pF
Cmax = 1000*(1+0.05)*(1+65*30e-6) = 1052.0475 pF
```

Substituting these endpoints into the typical coefficients illustrates
capacitor sensitivity only. It does not create minimum/maximum limits for
TI's typical slew or delay coefficients. Manufacturing/temperature variation
of the IC, additional capacitor effects, rail regulation, parasitics and
actual startup loading still require qualification. Keep an independent
power-stable reset delay; do not release module EN solely after a fixed
3.8 ms firmware wait.

### Reproducible arithmetic

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F

ct_pf = F(1000)
sr_coefficient = F(1900)
slew_mv_us = sr_coefficient/ct_pf
assert slew_mv_us == F('1.9')
assert F('3.8')*ct_pf == F(3800)
assert F('1.6')*ct_pf == F(1600)
output_u = F('0.1')+F(10)
assert output_u*slew_mv_us == F('19.19')
assert output_u*F(44) == F('444.4')
cmin = ct_pf*F('0.95')*(1-F(65)*F('0.000030'))
cmax = ct_pf*F('1.05')*(1+F(65)*F('0.000030'))
assert cmin == F('948.1475') and cmax == F('1052.0475')
assert F(50) >= F(7)

    slew = sr_coefficient/capacitance

## RADIO-009: SPI power-domain isolation

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Electrical selection record for the proposed
TXU0304PWR SPI isolator on [the radio sheet](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch).
Tracking: [issue #826](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/826).
The project-local `Power_Devices:TXU0304PWR` symbol implements the exact PW
pin map below, with explicit input/tri-state/power types and visible NC
contacts. Its 150 mil pins terminate on the 100 mil connection grid.
U5 is placed with VCCA on +3V3_MCU, VCCB on +3V3_RADIO and pin 7 on GND.
Its exact manufacturer and DigiKey ordering fields are included in the BOM.
C49 and C50 provide separate local supply bypasses. U5.13 connects to U3.6
(GPIO6, C6_SCLK), and U5.12 connects to U3.7 (GPIO7, C6_COPI).
U5.11 connects to U3.11 (GPIO10, C6_CS_N); U3.27 (GPIO2, C6_CIPO)
connects to U5.10. These four radio-side nets use local labels with separate
short connections, without crossing the supply domains directly.
The host SPI connections now pass through matching hierarchical ports and
straight top-sheet wires to the RADIO-008 allocation: U1.F13 (P702) to U5.2
for SCLK, U1.F15 (P701) to U5.3 for COPI, U1.G14 (P703) to U5.4 for CS_N,
and U5.5 to U1.F12 (P700) for CIPO. Host and C6 signal nets remain separate
on opposite sides of U5. Power enable remains U1.F16 (P707) to R7.1.
OE wiring, reset arbitration and the handshake/data-ready interfaces remain
incomplete; this is not a qualified circuit. The RADIO-009 schematic
annotation links to this section.

### Device and channel assignment

The authority is [TI TXU0304 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txu0304.pdf),
SCES935A, sections 6, 7.5, 7.11, 8.1, 9.3 and 12.1. The PW package has
14 pins, including visible NC contacts 6 and 9; it has no exposed-pad pin.
This is a fixed-direction buffer, not an automatic-direction TXB device.

| PW contact | Function | Proposed connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | VCCA | +3V3_MCU |
| 14 | VCCB | +3V3_RADIO |
| 7 | GND | Common GND |
| 2 -> 13 | A1 -> B1Y | Host SCLK -> C6 SCLK |
| 3 -> 12 | A2 -> B2Y | Host COPI -> C6 COPI |
| 4 -> 11 | A3 -> B3Y | Host CS_N -> C6 CS_N |
| 10 -> 5 | B4 -> A4Y | C6 CIPO -> host CIPO |
| 8 | OE, active high | Default-low interface enable; arbitration unresolved |
| 6, 9 | NC | Unconnected, visible in symbol |

Provide separate local 100 nF bypass capacitors from each supply to GND.
Do not bridge the two supplies through either capacitor. Both ports support
1.1..5.5 V, so equal nominal 3.3 V rails are permitted. This device provides
power-domain separation, not galvanic isolation.

C49 and C50 use TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA, 100 nF, +/-10%, 50 V X7R,
the same sourced ordering code as C45. C49 connects VCCA to GND; C50
connects VCCB to GND. The choice implements TI section 12.1's 100 nF local
bypass recommendation; it is not derived from the SPI bit period. Keep each
capacitor's eventual supply/return loop local to its corresponding IC pins.
Nominal capacitance, voltage rating and matching an application recommendation
do not establish transient performance or the finished power budget.

### Updated switched-rail capacitive-load accounting

C50 adds to the switched output load; C49 is on the upstream MCU domain and
does not. The earlier RADIO-004/RADIO-007 calculations record the C45+C46
population at those revisions. With C50 now fitted, update their capacitor-only
screens as follows, retaining all their stated limitations:

```text
Cexternal_nominal = C45 + C46 + C50 = 0.1 + 10 + 0.1 = 10.2 uF
t90_to_10 = Rdis * C * ln(9)
          = 150 ohm * 10.2e-6 F * ln(9) = 3.361754 ms typical-coefficient model
Icapacitive = C * slew = 10.2e-6 F * 1900 V/s = 19.38 mA
Open-CT comparison = 10.2e-6 F * 44000 V/s = 448.8 mA
```

These are not worst-case bounds. They exclude module internal capacitance,
IC operating current and future fitted components. The discharge screen uses
typical QOD resistance; the slew screen uses the earlier 3.6 V/25 C typical
coefficient rather than a guaranteed 3.3 V ramp. No fixed reset-release delay
may be inferred from either result.

### Conditional round-trip SPI timing budget

At VCCA=VCCB=3.3 +/-0.3 V, maximum propagation delay is 11 ns in each
direction over -40..125 C. TI specifies this with 5 pF load and 10 kohm
test resistance. A larger actual load is not covered by this timing claim.

For an initial 5 MHz SPI clock with opposite-edge launch and sample:

```text
T = 1/(5e6 Hz) = 200 ns
Half-cycle = T/2 = 100 ns
Translator round trip = 11 ns outbound SCLK + 11 ns inbound CIPO = 22 ns
Remaining budget = 100 - 22 = 78 ns

Required:
C6 clock-to-output + RA8P1 setup + trace/skew allowance < 78 ns
```

This is a conditional budget, NOT timing closure or a 5 MHz guarantee.
The chosen SPI mode, C6 clock-to-output limit, RA8P1 input setup requirement,
duty-cycle distortion, output loading and interconnect delay must satisfy
the inequality together. Frequency reduction does not resolve an invalid
logic threshold, off-state path or reset sequence.

### Power-off and enable constraints

For one supply at 0 V and the other within 0..5.5 V, TI specifies Ioff of
+/-2 uA per port contact over -40..85 C and +/-2.5 uA over -40..125 C,
with signal voltages in 0..5.5 V. The separate floating-supply leakage test
uses signals at GND; do not extend that test to a driven-high floating rail.

OE low disables all outputs. At the same 3.3 V timing test point, allow
42 ns maximum disable time over -40..125 C before treating outputs as
high impedance. This is a propagation limit under TI's stated test load,
not a complete rail-collapse or firmware sequencing allowance.

Use an external default-low OE network and establish valid power/reset
conditions before enabling. Do not connect OE directly to RADIO_PWR_EN and
assume that the load-switch command proves stable radio power. The C6-side
CS_N idle level and host-side CIPO idle level need explicit handling while
the buffer is disabled. GPIO handshakes, reset and debug paths require their
own off-state review; isolating these four SPI channels does not isolate
the complete module.

### Reproducible arithmetic

## RADIO-010: Idle-state bias

Applies to R9, R10, U5.8 (OE) and U3.11 (C6_CS_N) on
[the radio schematic](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch).
The schematic annotation links to this section. Tracking: issue #826.

R9 pulls translator OE to ground when no enable driver is active. R10
pulls chip select to the switched +3V3_RADIO supply when U5 is disabled.
Connecting R10 to +3V3_MCU instead would create an unwanted powered-to-off
path. Both are YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, DigiKey 311-10.0KHRCT-ND.

### Inputs and limits

- The [exact resistor specification](https://yageogroup.com/component-documentation/download/specsheet/RC0603FR-0710KL)
  gives 10 kohm, 1% tolerance, 100 ppm/C maximum TCR magnitude and 0.1 W
  rating at 70 C. Use a conservative 100 C excursion from 25 C for this
  resistance screen; this is not an extension of the module temperature rating.
- [TI TXU0304, section 7.5, p.7](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txu0304.pdf)
  gives minimum OE falling threshold VT- = 0.17 V at VCCA=VCCB=1.1 V.
  This is the lowest listed equal-rail test point, not a continuous ramp
  guarantee. OE is a Schmitt input; a generic CMOS VIL must not replace VT-.
- [Espressif module datasheet v1.4, Table 6-3, p.26](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf)
  specifies VIH = 0.75*VDD minimum at 3.3 V and 25 C. The calculation below
  does not extrapolate that table across temperature or the whole supply range.
- Total adverse node leakage is allocated 12 uA, including future control
  circuitry and board leakage. This is an engineering budget, NOT a measured
  or manufacturer-guaranteed aggregate. The final driver and all power states
  must demonstrate compliance. Disable a conflicting C6 internal pull-down;
  a configured output driving low is not leakage.

### Resistance and static voltage calculations

Use multiplicative initial tolerance and temperature factors:

```text
Temperature factor = 100 ppm/C * 100 C = 0.01
Rmin = 10000*(1-0.01)*(1-0.01) = 9801 ohm
Rmax = 10000*(1+0.01)*(1+0.01) = 10201 ohm

R9 worst allocated default-low voltage:
VOE = Iadverse*Rmax = 12e-6*10201 = 0.122412 V
Margin to the listed 1.1 V test-point VT- = 0.17-0.122412 = 0.047588 V

R10 worst allocated idle voltage at 3.3 V:
VCS = Vradio-Iadverse*Rmax = 3.3-0.122412 = 3.177588 V
VIH = 0.75*3.3 = 2.475 V
Static high margin = 3.177588-2.475 = 0.702588 V
```

These are conditional static screens. They do not establish startup,
brownout, unequal-rail transient behavior, output-enable timing or SPI
timing closure. R9 currently holds OE disabled; an active enable driver
and its power/reset arbitration are still required for operation.

### Current and power tradeoff

```text
Nominal R9 current with OE driven to 3.3 V = 3.3/10000 = 0.330 mA
Nominal R10 current with CS driven to 0 V = 3.3/10000 = 0.330 mA
Maximum screen current with 3.6 V across either resistor = 3.6/9801
  = 0.367309458 mA
Maximum screen dissipation = 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314050 mW
```

R9's enabled current belongs in the active-radio budget. R10 draws this
current while CS is low, not while it is idle high. Actual current depends
on driver VOH/VOL. The power comparison uses the 70 C rating only; thermal
derating is not qualified here. No RC settling time is asserted because
the actual node capacitance and final driver have not been established.

## RADIO-011: Radio supervisor threshold design

U6 is the candidate TPS389001DSET on
[the radio schematic](../ereader/radio_esp32.kicad_sch), with C51 local bypass.
Tracking: #826 and the upstream supply design in #825. This record explains
the threshold constraint; it does not approve an unfinished reset network.

### Part identity and connection boundary

[TI SLVSD65A, sections 5-7](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps3890.pdf)
identifies the adjustable device's nominal falling threshold as 1.15 V,
threshold accuracy as +/-1%, and maximum hysteresis as 0.825% of the falling
threshold. Section 6 specifies pins 1 SENSE, 2 GND, 3 active-low MR, 4 VDD,
5 CT and 6 active-low open-drain RESET. CT uses a ground-referenced capacitor,
unlike the former TPS22917 VIN-referenced slew capacitor, now removed.
VDD operates from 1.5 to 5.5 V.

The native KiCad symbol has this exact mapping, visible pins, open-collector
ERC type for the open-drain output, 150 mil pins, 100 mil endpoint grid,
50 mil text and a 10 mil filled body outline. It is a separate symbol;
U2 now also uses TPS389001DSET under RST-002; its targeted connectivity
check is complete, not full-system qualification. No inherited SOT-23
footprint is retained.

U6 VDD is connected to upstream +3V3_MCU so it can remain powered while
the radio rail discharges. C51 is TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA, 100 nF ceramic
to GND, following TI's section 6 bypass recommendation. It adds no
capacitance to the switched-radio discharge model. See PWR-001 for the
exact capacitor's nominal bias calculation, not a guaranteed PDN bound.

MR is connected to U7.4 RADIO_MR_N (RADIO-015). C52 connects CT to ground (RADIO-012).
RESET now drives C6_EN with R11 pulled up to +3V3_RADIO (RADIO-013).
R12/R13 sense the switched radio rail with the current RST-002 selections;
RADIO-014 below preserves their former values and historical arithmetic.
Upstream-domain MR arbitration is drawn, not a complete sequencing proof.

[DigiKey's exact DSET listing](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/TPS389001DSET/6110554)
was inspected on 2026-09-05: Active, 2090 in stock, 26-week lead time,
USD 2.22 / 1.643 / 1.3395 at 1 / 10 / 100. Orderable cut-tape code is
296-44489-1-ND. This is an availability snapshot, not reserved inventory.

### Why the divider cannot be selected by nominal voltage alone

Let Rt connect the monitored rail to SENSE and Rb connect SENSE to ground.
For positive input current Is flowing into SENSE, Kirchhoff's current law is:

```text
(Vrail - Vsense)/Rt = Vsense/Rb + Is
Vrail_trip = Vsense_trip*(1 + Rt/Rb) + Is*Rt
```

For a screening exercise, allocate 0.1% initial resistor tolerance,
25 ppm/C TCR and a conservative 100 C excursion from 25 C. These are
example divider specifications, NOT fitted resistor selections. Allocate
100 nA adverse SENSE-node current in either direction. TI gives a 100 nA
SENSE current maximum for the adjustable device at a 5 V test point;
the symmetric all-state node allowance here still needs qualification.

```text
fmin = (1-0.001)*(1-25e-6*100) = 0.9965025
fmax = (1+0.001)*(1+25e-6*100) = 1.0035025
Rtmin/max = Rt_nom * fmin/max; Rbmin/max = Rb_nom * fmin/max

Vfall_min = 1.15*(1-0.01)*(1 + Rtmin/Rbmax) - 100e-9*Rtmax
Vrise_max = 1.15*(1+0.01)*(1+0.00825)*(1 + Rtmax/Rbmin)
            + 100e-9*Rtmax
```

The rising expression conservatively combines falling-threshold accuracy
and maximum hysteresis. It is not an additional independent accuracy term
applied on top of the separately specified nominal rising threshold.

| Example Rt / Rb | Minimum falling screen | Maximum rising screen | Margin below 3.1465 V loaded-rail screen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16.5k / 10k | 3.002265442 V | 3.118597548 V | 27.902452 mV |
| 16.7k / 10k | 3.024856538 V | 3.142203792 V | 4.296208 mV |
| 33.2k / 20k | 3.011895176 V | 3.132066484 V | 14.433516 mV |

The first example has only 2.265442 mV static margin above the module's
3.0 V minimum; the second has only 4.296208 mV release headroom. The third
balances the two but still leaves little transient allowance. None is an
approved divider at this screening stage. RADIO-014 records the subsequent
R12/R13 selection with additional drift and leakage allocations. The 3.1465 V
source is RADIO-004's conditional rail screen,
not a guaranteed final supply. Precision-divider selection and the actual
regulator/load-switch budget must be resolved together.

Static threshold headroom also does not prove brownout timing. The available
time during a falling rail is DeltaV/abs(dV/dt); it must cover supervisor
assertion delay, reset-node fall time and enable-path response at their
applicable limits. A typical propagation figure cannot establish that bound.
Controlled shutdown must disable the signal paths before switching off power.
Final CT sizing must independently satisfy C6 reset/startup timing and
leakage/capacitance tolerances. RADIO-012 records the subsequent C52 selection;
the complete reset sequence remains unqualified.

## RADIO-012: Supervisor reset-release delay

Revision 1, 2026-09-07. C52 connects U6.5 (CT) to GND. It is not on
the switched supply and does not add to RADIO-009's 10.2 uF rail load.
The RADIO-012 schematic annotation links here. Tracking: #826.

C52 uses the same exact sourced capacitor as the removed C48:
[TDK C1608NP01H102J080AA](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C1608NP01H102J080AA),
1 nF +/-5%, 50 V NP0, 0 +/-30 ppm/C. The dated 2026-09-05 sourcing
snapshot is retained in its BOM fields, not represented as live inventory.
Unlike former C48's VIN-referenced load-switch slew control, C52 is a
ground-referenced supervisor delay capacitor. Their descriptions and
selection-basis fields deliberately differ.

[TI TPS3890 SLVSD65A](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps3890.pdf),
section 8.3.1 equation 1, gives the delay model C*VCT/ICT plus the nominal
open-CT delay. Section 7.5 gives VCT = 1.17/1.23/1.29 V and
ICT = 0.90/1.15/1.35 uA (minimum/typical/maximum). Section 7.6 lists
25 us nominal open-CT delay at VDD = 3.3 V; this is not a maximum bound.

[Espressif's power-up/reset guidance](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-hardware-design-guidelines/en/latest/esp32c6/schematic-checklist.html#chip-power-up-and-reset-timing)
requires 50 us minimum supply stabilization before enable and 50 us minimum
reset-low duration. These are separate requirements. A delay following a
threshold crossing does not prove the supply has already stabilized.

For an initial 100 C temperature excursion from 25 C, allocate 10 nA total
external CT-node leakage in either direction. This allocation must cover the
capacitor, PCB and any other connected path; it is not an additional TI
internal charge-current tolerance. Assuming CT starts discharged:

```text
Cmin = 1 nF*(1-0.05)*(1-100*30e-6) = 947.15 pF
Cmax = 1 nF*(1+0.05)*(1+100*30e-6) = 1053.15 pF
t_nom = 1e-9*1.23/1.15e-6 + 25e-6 = 1.094565217 ms
t_charge_min = 947.15e-12*1.17/(1.35e-6+10e-9)
             = 814.827574 us
t_charge_max = 1053.15e-12*1.29/(0.90e-6-10e-9)
             = 1526.475843 us
```

The charge-only minimum screen is about 16.3 times 50 us. It supports
the initial 1 nF choice without using a large X7R capacitor as a precision
timing element. The charge-only maximum is NOT a total reset-release
maximum: additional propagation/startup terms have no maximum supplied by
this calculation. Do not add 25 us typical and label the result guaranteed.
Residual CT voltage, leakage beyond the allocation, rapid retriggering and
supply transients require evaluation. No external signal or test connector
is attached to CT. Keep its physical loop short and clean.

U6's manual-reset arbitration is implemented in RADIO-015; RST-002 updates
its SENSE divider. RADIO-013 implements the RESET-to-EN path. Supply stabilization
and the minimum actual C6 EN-low interval
remain subject to qualification. C52 alone does not close
power-cycle, brownout or reset acceptance.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from math import isclose

cmin = F('1e-9')*F('.95')*F('.997')
cmax = F('1e-9')*F('1.05')*F('1.003')
assert cmin*10**12 == F('947.15')
assert cmax*10**12 == F('1053.15')
tnom = F('1e-9')*F('1.23')/F('1.15e-6')+F('25e-6')
tmin = cmin*F('1.17')/(F('1.35e-6')+F('10e-9'))
tmax = cmax*F('1.29')/(F('.90e-6')-F('10e-9'))

## RADIO-013: Reset output and module enable pull-up

Revision 1, 2026-09-07. U6.6 RESET, U3.3 EN and R11.2 share local net
C6_EN on the radio sheet. R11.1 connects to +3V3_RADIO, not +3V3_MCU.
The native RADIO-013 annotation links to this record. Tracking: #826.

R11 is YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, 10k +/-1%, using RADIO-010's exact
resistor selection and dated sourcing snapshot. Its 100 ppm/C rating and
100 C excursion allocation give:

```text
Rmin = 10000*(1-0.01)*(1-100*100e-6) = 9801 ohm
Rmax = 10000*(1+0.01)*(1+100*100e-6) = 10201 ohm
```

[TI TPS3890 SLVSD65A](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps3890.pdf),
section 7.5, specifies RESET VOL <=0.25 V at 0.4 mA with VDD >=1.5 V;
the higher-current 2 mA condition requires VDD >=2.7 V. Use the weaker
0.4 mA condition here. The output is open drain. Its listed 250 nA
high-impedance leakage uses VSENSE = VRESET = 5.5 V, not every power state.

[ESP32-C6-WROOM-1 v1.4](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf),
Table 6-3, specifies reset release at >=0.75*VDD and reset at <=0.25*VDD.
The table is explicitly scoped to 3.3 V, 25 C. Its input-current entries
are 50 nA, and pin capacitance is 2 pF typical, not a maximum circuit load.

Allocate 12 uA total adverse node leakage, including all connected devices
and board leakage. This is a design allocation, not a measured total or
an all-state vendor guarantee. No extra push-pull driver is connected.

```text
Conservative sink screen at rail <=3.6 V:
I_RESET <= 3.6/9801 + 12e-6 = 0.379309458 mA < 0.4 mA
(Using zero node voltage overestimates the pull-up current.)

At the module's 3.3 V / 25 C table point:
EN_high >= 3.3 - 12e-6*10201 = 3.177588 V
VIH_nRST = 0.75*3.3 = 2.475 V
High-level margin = 0.702588 V
VIL_nRST = 0.25*3.3 = 0.825 V
Low-level margin with U6 VOL=0.25 V = 0.575 V

Nominal asserted pull-up current upper screen = 3.3/10000 = 0.330 mA
Worst resistor power screen = 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314050 mW
```

R11 adds no intentional DC pull-up from the live MCU rail to an unpowered
module. This does not by itself prove zero off-state leakage through U6:
its partial-power states and future OE circuitry still need review.
Do not connect an independently powered programmer's push-pull reset output
to C6_EN. Route external reset requests through the RADIO-015 MR arbitration.

No extra capacitor is placed on EN: C52 sets the supervisor delay instead.
EN rise time depends on R11 and actual node capacitance; the module's
typical 2 pF pin value cannot establish a maximum delay. Reevaluate this
network when adding any OE-sense input, test access or other capacitance.
The MR input is connected through RADIO-015, and RST-002 updates SENSE.
Radio DC release remains unresolved with current U4. The numerical
logic margins above do not extend the module table to all temperatures.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'

## RADIO-014: Switched-radio sense divider

Historical selection and arithmetic below are superseded by
[RST-002](reset_coordination_tps3890.md). Current native R12 is Panasonic
ERA-6ARW333V 33k and R13 is Susumu RG1608N-203-W-T1 20k, both
0.05% / 10 ppm/C. Their conditional rising range is
3.019118825..3.113278988 V. The TPS22964 migration is now drawn under
RADIO-019, but complete path-loss qualification remains open. The old 33.2k
selection, sourcing snapshots, PWR-002 headroom and Python below describe
the former checkpoint only, not the present fitted values or rail.

Revision 1, 2026-09-07. R12 connects +3V3_RADIO to U6.1 SENSE; R13
connects that node to GND. Both are placed and wired in the native radio
schematic at that checkpoint. Its former RADIO-014 annotation linked here;
the current RADIO-014 / RST-002 native note links to RST-002 instead.
Tracking: #826 / #825.

[Susumu RG specification, pp.17-18](https://www.susumu.co.jp/dl/?filename=n_catalog_partition01_en.pdf&type=application/pdf)
decodes P as 25 ppm/C and B as 0.1%. These are regular-power 0.1 W,
0603 parts; no correlated ratio tracking is assumed between discrete parts.
The reliability tests are defined stress conditions, not an unconditional
lifetime guarantee. Allocate an additional +/-0.15% resistance change per
part for assembly/aging. This allowance requires qualification against the
actual manufacturing process and intended service environment.

### Extended static corner calculation

Use RADIO-011's KCL and TI threshold/hysteresis limits. Add the independent
0.15% drift allowance and enlarge the total adverse SENSE-node current
allocation to +/-150 nA. The latter includes TI's listed 100 nA test-point
maximum plus 50 nA board allowance; it is not a guarantee for every state.
Use a 100 C excursion for the TCR screen, with no extension of component
operating-temperature ratings.

           = 3.139621574 V
Static margin above module minimum = 3.004600118-3 = 4.600118 mV
PWR-002 static release headroom = 3.154544111-3.139621574
                              = 14.922537 mV
Nominal divider current at 3.3 V = 3.3/53200 = 62.030075 uA
No-leak current screen at 3.6 V = 3.6/(53200*fmin) = 68.008690 uA
Conservative rail-current bound including leakage < 68.159 uA
Per-resistor power upper bound: 3.6^2/Rmin < 0.652 mW for either part
```

The falling expression deliberately uses the largest negative leakage term
even though that resistance corner differs from the minimum-ratio corner.
It is a conservative bound, not a claim that both occur simultaneously.
The calculation below also checks all actual endpoint combinations.

This divider adds DC load but no capacitor to RADIO-009's external-capacitance
sum. Do not add a SENSE filter capacitor without recalculating brownout delay.
Route the sense connection from the module supply node and keep its ground
reference local; routing drop is not included in the numbers above.

Only 4.6 mV remains in the falling static screen. This is insufficient by
itself to claim reset asserts before a rapidly falling supply reaches 3 V.
The allowed rail slew must satisfy
abs(dV/dt) <= (Vfall_min-3 V)/(tassert_max+tENfall_max), using valid worst-case
timing limits and overdrive conditions, not typical curves. MR arbitration,
controlled shutdown and the final regulator/load-switch transient budget
remain required. R12/R13 are the implemented divider, not approval of the
complete reset or power architecture. Revise the selection if those budgets
cannot be met.

## RADIO-015: Reset request arbitration

Revision 2, 2026-09-07. Native radio-sheet circuit: U7, C53 and R14.
The RADIO-015 schematic note links to this section. Tracking: #826.
The root connects RADIO_RESET_REQ_N from the IO-allocation sheet to U7.6.
MCU_RESET_N is exported from the clocks/debug sheet and connected through
the root's named net to U7.3. Netlist checks verify U1.E17/R14.1/U7.6 share
the host-request net and U2.1/U1.D5/J1.10/U7.3 share the hardware-reset net.
This establishes connectivity, not complete electrical qualification.

### Selection and connection contract

U7 is TI SN74LVC1G97DBVR, DigiKey 296-15581-1-ND.
The [DigiKey listing](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/SN74LVC1G97DBVR/571196)
was checked 2026-09-07: Active, indexed stock 30,722, USD 0.23 / 0.16 /
0.12130 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100, standard lead time nine weeks.
This is a dated sourcing snapshot, not an order quote.

[TI SCES416N sections 5, 6.3, 6.5 and 8.4](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc1g97.pdf)
specify Schmitt inputs and 1.65-5.5 V operation. Pin 1 is IN1, 2 GND,
3 IN0, 4 Y, 5 VCC, 6 IN2. The function table gives Y = IN2 ? IN0 : IN1.
With IN1 grounded, Y = IN0 AND IN2. At the 3 V test point, VT- minimum
is 0.84 V and VT+ maximum is 1.87 V. At 100 uA output load, VOL is at
most 0.1 V and VOH at least VCC-0.1 V over the operating supply range.
Input leakage is specified at +/-5 uA for the listed rail-endpoint
conditions, and Ioff at +/-10 uA with VCC=0. These do not specify
logic behavior during sub-minimum supply ramps.

| U7 pin | Connection | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 IN0 | MCU_RESET_N hierarchical input | Hardware MCU reset qualification |
| 1 IN1 | GND | Configure the AND function |
| 6 IN2 | RADIO_RESET_REQ_N hierarchical input, R14 to GND | Host release request, default low |
| 4 Y | RADIO_MR_N local net to U6.3 MR | Assert radio reset if either input is low |
| 5 VCC | +3V3_MCU | Upstream, not switched-radio supply |
| 2 GND | GND | Common reference |

C53 reuses TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA, 100 nF, 50 V, X7R, 10%.
It bypasses U7's MCU-rail supply to GND. Its exact nominal bias calculation
is [PWR-001](power_decoupling.md#nominal-dc-bias-screening-and-shared-bypass-selection).
It is not part of the switched-radio discharge capacitance.
R14 reuses RADIO-010's YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, 10k, 1% sourced part.
Its procurement fields retain the original dated snapshot.

### Bias arithmetic and conditional interface screen

Use the same independent 1% initial tolerance and 100 ppm/K over a 100 K
excursion as RADIO-010. This temperature excursion is a calculation
allocation, not permission to exceed a component's temperature rating.
Allocate 12 uA adverse request-node current, including gate, host and board
contributions. The host's selected pin and all power states must meet it.

```text
Rmin = 10000*(1-0.01)*(1-100e-6*100) = 9801 ohm
Rmax = 10000*(1+0.01)*(1+100e-6*100) = 10201 ohm
Vrequest_low <= 12e-6*10201 = 0.122412 V
3 V test-point low margin = 0.84-0.122412 = 0.717588 V
Resistor current at 3.6 V <= 3.6/9801 = 0.367309 mA
Resistor dissipation <= 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314 mW
```

The 3 V margin is only a test-point screen. Do not interpolate Schmitt
thresholds and present them as guaranteed limits over the final rail range.

[TPS3890 section 7.5](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps3890.pdf)
requires MR low <=0.25*VDD and high >=0.7*VDD. Conditional on total U7
output loading remaining within 100 uA, both devices sharing a valid
3.0-3.6 V rail gives the following worst-endpoint margins:

```text
MR low margin >= 0.25*3.0-0.1 = 0.65 V
MR high margin >= (3.0-0.1)-0.7*3.0 = 0.8 V
```

The supervisor's MR current, including current flowing out while low, has
not yet been bounded by a guaranteed maximum in this analysis. Therefore
the 100 uA condition is an allocation, not a verified load. These margins
do not close the reset interface. Host startup state,
input thresholds over the chosen rail range, MR loading, shutdown ordering,
reset pulse duration, and supply-ramp behavior must be resolved before
calling the complete reset path electrically qualified. U5 OE arbitration
remains separate; U7 does not make the SPI interface safe by itself.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from itertools import product
from math import isclose

rmin = F(10000)*F('.99')*F('.99')
rmax = F(10000)*F('1.01')*F('1.01')
assert rmin == 9801 and rmax == 10201
vlo = F('12e-6')*rmax
assert vlo == F('.122412')
assert F('.84')-vlo == F('.717588')
assert isclose(float(F('3.6')/rmin*1000), .3673094582185491)
assert isclose(float(F('3.6')**2/rmin*1000), 1.3223140495867767)
for rail in (F(3), F('3.6')):
    assert F('.25')*rail-F('.1') >= F('.65')
    assert rail-F('.1')-F('.7')*rail >= F('.8')
for hardware_release, host_release in product((False, True), repeat=2):
    in1 = False
    mux_y = hardware_release if host_release else in1
    assert mux_y == (hardware_release and host_release)
print('RADIO-015 PASS: truth table and conditional DC arithmetic; '
      'load limits and sequencing remain unqualified.')
PY
```

## RADIO-016: SPI output-enable arbitration

Revision 1, 2026-09-07. Native radio-sheet circuit: U8 and C54, driving
U5.8 through SPI_IO_EN with the existing R9 default-low resistor.
The RADIO-016 schematic note links here. Tracking: #826.

U8 reuses RADIO-015's exact SN74LVC1G97DBVR selection and dated sourcing
snapshot. C54 reuses the exact TDK 100 nF bypass from C53; the nominal
capacitance calculation is [PWR-001](power_decoupling.md#nominal-dc-bias-screening-and-shared-bypass-selection).
Neither component changes the switched-radio capacitance sum.

| U8 pin | Net | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 IN0 | C6_EN | Radio supervisor reset release; U3.3 and U6.6 |
| 1 IN1 | GND | Select AND function |
| 6 IN2 | RADIO_PWR_EN | Host request, upstream of R7 |
| 4 Y | SPI_IO_EN | U5.8 OE, U25.6 OE and R9.1 |
| 5 VCC | +3V3_MCU | Upstream supply, bypassed by C54 |
| 2 GND | GND | Common reference |

With valid supplies, SPI_IO_EN = C6_EN AND RADIO_PWR_EN. Reset assertion
or a low host power request therefore requests SPI isolation. C6_EN is
reset release, NOT firmware-ready; the host must keep chip select inactive
and clock idle until the radio protocol is ready. Logic connectivity does
not establish shutdown timing or behavior during sub-minimum supply ramps.

### Conditional DC calculations

[TI SN74LVC1G97 sections 6.5 and 8.4](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc1g97.pdf)
provide the gate function, input leakage test limit of 5 uA, and the 3 V,
16 mA output limits VOH >=2.4 V and VOL <=0.45 V through 125 C.
[TI TXU0304 section 7.5](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txu0304.pdf)
gives OE thresholds at equal 3 V supplies: VT+ <=1.92 V and VT- >=0.89 V;
OE leakage is -0.1 to 2 uA at the listed powered rail-endpoint conditions.
These are discrete test-point limits, not an interpolated full-rail proof.

Use RADIO-010's resistor bounds of 9801 to 10201 ohm. Allocate 14 uA
total adverse OE-node current including U5, U25 and board leakage. RADIO-020
adds 2 uA for U25 without consuming the previous 12 uA allowance. This is an
allocation for unqualified states, not a substitute for their specifications.

```text
U8 high-state DC load <= 3.6/9801 + 14e-6 = 0.381309 mA
0.381309 mA < 16 mA output test current
3 V test-point high margin = 2.4 - 1.92 = 0.48 V
3 V test-point low margin = 0.89 - 0.45 = 0.44 V
R9 dissipation <= 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314 mW
```

Do not use the gate's 100 uA VOH limit: R9 alone exceeds that loading.
The margins above screen a valid 3 V operating point; unequal supplies,
power ramps and the complete temperature/rail envelope remain open.

U8 also loads C6_EN and RADIO_PWR_EN. Reserve 5 uA for each gate input
within each node's 12 uA total allocation, leaving 7 uA for the other
contributors. RADIO-013's R11 calculations remain conditional on that
total; adding U8 does not silently grant an extra leakage allowance.
The supervisor, ESP32 EN, host pin, U4 ON and board contributions require
closure in their applicable states. Gate input capacitance also adds to
the reset edge load; no maximum reset-fall time is claimed here.

For a high-impedance host request, bound the complete R7/R8 path current
by a 12 uA adverse allocation. Treating all of it as flowing through both
resistors gives a conservative request-node screen:

```text
Vrequest_low <= 12e-6*(10201+10201) = 0.244824 V
U8 3 V test-point low margin = 0.84-0.244824 = 0.595176 V
```

This does not bound a host actively driving or internally pulling high.
Hardware startup pin state, enable/disable timing relative to load-switch
turnoff, brownout response and off-state leakage remain required before
the interface can be described as electrically qualified. No issue is
closed by this static screen.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from itertools import product
from math import isclose

rmin, rmax = F(9801), F(10201)
allocation = F('12e-6')
oe_allocation = allocation + F('2e-6')  # U25; request-node allowance unchanged.
load = F('3.6')/rmin + oe_allocation
assert isclose(float(load*1000), .3813094582185491)
assert F('.0001') < load < F('.016')
assert F('2.4')-F('1.92') == F('.48')
assert F('.89')-F('.45') == F('.44')
assert isclose(float(F('3.6')**2/rmin*1000), 1.3223140495867767)
assert allocation-F('5e-6') == F('7e-6')
request_low = allocation*(rmax+rmax)
assert request_low == F('.244824')
assert F('.84')-request_low == F('.595176')
for reset_release, power_request in product((False, True), repeat=2):
    mux_y = reset_release if power_request else False
    assert mux_y == (reset_release and power_request)
print('RADIO-016 PASS: truth table and conditional DC arithmetic; '
      'full sequencing and leakage qualification remain open.')
PY
```

## RADIO-017: Boot and debug strap bias

Revision 1, 2026-09-07. R15/R16/R17 on the radio sheet implement
switched-rail pull-ups for U3 GPIO8, GPIO9 and GPIO15 respectively.
The RADIO-017 schematic note links here. Tracking: #826.

All three reuse YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, 10k, 1%, DigiKey
311-10.0KHRCT-ND, with RADIO-010's exact specification and dated sourcing
snapshot retained in the BOM. Their supply is +3V3_RADIO, not +3V3_MCU.
This avoids introducing an upstream-rail pull-up into an unpowered module.

[Espressif module datasheet v1.4, Tables 3-1, 4-1 through 4-7 and 6-3](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c6-wroom-1_wroom-1u_datasheet_en.pdf)
identifies GPIO8/9/15 as contacts 10/15/23. GPIO9 has a weak internal
pull-up; GPIO8 and GPIO15 float by default. Flash boot requires GPIO9
high. Download boot requires GPIO8 high and GPIO9 low. Keep straps stable
for at least 3 ms after EN rises. GPIO15 high selects USB JTAG when
strap-based selection is enabled and neither debug path is disabled by
eFuse; default eFuses already select USB JTAG. A pull-up cannot override
an eFuse disabling an interface. The listed internal pull-up resistance
is 45k typical, not a guaranteed minimum. Table 6-3 applies at 3.3 V,
25 C and gives input VIH >=0.75*VDD and input current <=50 nA.

| Part | Module pin | Net | Intended reset-time level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R15 | U3.10 GPIO8 | C6_GPIO8 | High, including download mode |
| R16 | U3.15 GPIO9 | C6_BOOT_N | High normally; externally low for recovery |
| R17 | U3.23 GPIO15 | C6_GPIO15 | High for USB debug-source selection |

TP3 now provides internal low-driving service pads in RADIO-018. Programming
data access is not yet installed. Complete leakage, sink current, off-state
behavior and strap timing must be included before recovery is qualified.
MTMS/MTDI control SDIO edge choices;
this SPI-hosted design does not use SDIO recovery. Do not infer their
external loading is harmless for a future SDIO implementation.

### Pull-up calculation

Reuse the independently applied 1% tolerance and 100 ppm/K over 100 K
resistance screen from RADIO-010. The excursion is an arithmetic envelope,
not permission to exceed the module's rated temperature range. Allocate
12 uA total adverse current per strap, including module, board and eventual
recovery-circuit leakage. This exceeds the quoted 25 C input-current limit
but is not yet a proven all-state total. Ignore the helpful internal GPIO9
pull-up in the high-level calculation.

```text
Rmin = 10000*(1-0.01)*(1-100e-6*100) = 9801 ohm
Rmax = 10000*(1+0.01)*(1+100e-6*100) = 10201 ohm
Vstrap_high >= 3.3 - 12e-6*10201 = 3.177588 V
VIH at the stated 3.3 V test point = 0.75*3.3 = 2.475 V
High-level margin = 3.177588 - 2.475 = 0.702588 V
External pull-up current when held low <= 3.6/9801 = 0.367309 mA
External resistor dissipation <= 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314 mW
Three external pull-ups simultaneously held low <= 1.101928 mA
```

The low-state current calculation covers external resistors only. Add
GPIO9's internal pull-up and any other sources to the eventual recovery
driver sink budget; a typical 45k value cannot establish its worst case.
Do not extrapolate the input threshold test point across the full rail and
temperature range without evidence. The 3 ms strap hold requirement is
not a capacitor-value calculation; no strap capacitors are fitted here.
Keep these nets reserved through reset/strap sampling, and do not configure
conflicting pull-downs or outputs as part of normal radio startup.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from math import isclose

rmin = F(10000)*F('.99')*F('.99')
rmax = F(10000)*F('1.01')*F('1.01')
assert (rmin,rmax) == (F(9801),F(10201))
strap_high = F('3.3')-F('12e-6')*rmax
assert strap_high == F('3.177588')
assert strap_high-F('.75')*F('3.3') == F('.702588')
current = F('3.6')/rmin
assert isclose(float(current*1000), .3673094582185491)
assert isclose(float(3*current*1000), 1.1019283746556474)
assert isclose(float(F('3.6')**2/rmin*1000), 1.3223140495867767)
assert F('12e-6') > F('50e-9')
print('RADIO-017 PASS: conditional strap bias and external-resistor '
      'current arithmetic; complete recovery qualification open.')
PY
```

## RADIO-018: Internal BOOT service pads

Revision 2, 2026-09-07. TP3 replaces the radio BOOT switch with two
internal bare copper service pads: pad 1 is C6_BOOT_N and pad 2 is GND.
The native symbol is Connector:TestPoint_2Pole. It is included on the board
but excluded from the purchased BOM and position files; it is not a DNP
component. The RADIO-018 schematic note links here. Tracking: #826/#832.
There is no user-accessible radio BOOT control and no power input at TP3.
Physical pad geometry and fixture access remain part of the deferred PCB.

### Fixture electrical calculation

Use RADIO-017's R16 bounds, 9801..10201 ohm. Allocate at most 1 mA
total sink current, including the internal GPIO9 pull-up and board
contributions, and at most 1 ohm for the complete asserted fixture path.
These are fixture design allocations, not specifications of an already
selected fixture. The internal pull-up's guaranteed minimum resistance
remains unestablished, so the total current bound is conditional.

```text
Iexternal_max <= 3.6/9801 = 0.367309458 mA
Vclosed_max <= 1e-3*1 = 0.001 V = 1 mV
Ppath_max <= (1e-3)^2*1 = 1 uW
3.3 V, 25 C low-level margin = 0.25*3.3-0.001 = 0.824 V
```

The low-level comparison uses the module's stated 3.3 V, 25 C test point;
it does not establish all-temperature thresholds. Do not configure GPIO9
as a driven-high output while the fixture can ground it. That would
invalidate the 1 mA allocation and create output contention. Fixture
contact materials and minimum reliable sensing current require their own
qualification; the removed switch's contact ratings no longer apply.

### Service entry contract

The fixture establishes a stable low on GPIO9 before the radio EN rising
edge and retains it for at least the following 3 ms strap hold interval
from RADIO-017. GPIO8 remains high through R15. Do not add a BOOT capacitor
to conceal contact bounce; that changes setup and release timing.

Grounding TP1 on the MCU sheet asserts the MCU supervisor's MR input,
which also qualifies radio reset through U7/U6. Host reset can deassert
RADIO_PWR_EN. Thus these service pads alone still do not provide recovery
from broken host firmware. Host-independent radio power/reset arbitration
and protected programming data access remain to be connected. Do not mark
recovery complete merely because the BOOT pads are present.

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
from fractions import Fraction as F
from math import isclose

rmin = F(9801)
allocated_current, allocated_path = F('.001'), F(1)
vclosed = allocated_current*allocated_path
assert vclosed == F('.001')
assert allocated_current**2*allocated_path == F('1e-6')
assert isclose(float(F('3.6')/rmin*1000), .3673094582185491)
assert F('.25')*F('3.3')-vclosed == F('.824')
print('RADIO-018 PASS: conditional fixture-current and voltage arithmetic; '
      'complete service recovery remains unqualified.')
PY
```


## RADIO-019: TPS22964C low-loss switch migration

Revision 2, 2026-09-12. **U4 TPS22964CYZPT is implemented in native KiCad**
with R7 4.7k/R8 10k and C48 removed. A targeted read-only check of the
working XML export confirms the six-ball mapping, exact ON partition and
component values below. Native/CLI ERC and initial full PDF review are
complete as recorded in the opening status; final revised page-9 review
and full BOM reconciliation also passed. This is not whole-circuit
acceptance or hardware qualification. RADIO-018 remains
reserved for the existing internal BOOT pads. Tracking: #826 and #846.
[RST-002](reset_coordination_tps3890.md) owns reset thresholds;
[PWR-006](main_regulator_tps63806.md) owns the main-rail envelope.

### Exact connection and domain changes

[TI SLVSBS6A Rev A, sections 7, 8.3-8.6 and 10-11](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps22963c.pdf)
is the primary authority for the TPS22964C variant, which includes QOD.
Use the exact YZP ball names, not the old numbered SOT-23 pin mapping:

| U4 ball | Role | Verified net |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A2, B2 | VIN | +3V3_MCU, both connected; retain C47 input bypass |
| A1, B1 | VOUT | +3V3_RADIO, both connected |
| C1 | GND | GND |
| C2 | ON | RADIO_PWR_EN through R7 4.7k, with R8 10k to GND |

R7 is changed from 10k to 4.7k, retaining its series position and R8 10k
shunt. C48 and its obsolete CT node are removed. There is no external CT
or QOD terminal. Preserve
U8.6 on the raw host request, U5 signal isolation, U6/C52/R11 reset control,
C45/C46/C50 switched bypasses, and separate host/radio SPI nodes.
No new BIAS supply or AON_HOLD load is introduced. The working export
contains ON exactly as U4.C2/R7.2/R8.1; C48 is absent and U4/R7/R8 values
are TPS22964CYZPT/4.7k/10k. This confirms the stated local connectivity.
Native and CLI ERC retain the same 141 baseline findings, not merely the
same count; no exclusion or ignored-check change is claimed as a fix. The
refreshed native BOM has 19 columns/84 groups. All 210 included references,
values and MPNs match XML; there are no duplicates and only TP1-TP3 are
excluded. All 12 PDF pages were reviewed, including final review of the
re-exported page-9 wording correction. Electrical, startup and power-off
qualification remains open.

### Conditional path and enable-divider calculation

TI specifies 27 milliohm maximum at VIN=3.3 V and 29 milliohm at 2.5 V,
each at 200 mA magnitude and -40..85 C. These are discrete test points.
Neither establishes a continuous-rail, 505 mA installed maximum. Require
**30 milliohm maximum installed switch resistance** across the actual
rail/load/temperature range as a qualification allocation. The 505 mA
screen reserves 500 mA for radio demand and 5 mA for associated branch
loads; it is not a current limiter or extra permission beyond the main
power budget. Reconcile every actual contributor before release.

```text
Ipath = 0.505 A; total path loss allocation = 0.020 V
Rpath_max = 0.020/0.505 = 0.0396039604 ohm
Rremaining = Rpath_max-0.030 = 0.0096039604 ohm
Switch drop = 0.505*0.030 = 0.01515 V
Remaining series drop = 0.00485 V
Radio minimum = 3.151819680-0.020 = 3.131819680 V
Reset-release headroom = 3.131819680-3.113278988 = 0.018540692 V
Switch conduction screen = 0.505^2*0.030 = 0.00765075 W
```

The remaining resistance covers all intervening traces, vias and contacts.
PWR-006 already includes its single 75 mV main disturbance allocation;
do not subtract it twice or spend the reset margin as another independent
transient allowance. Local radio transients must fit the declared envelope.

For VIN=2.5..5.5 V, ON requires high >=1.3 V and low <=0.6 V;
for VIN=1..2.49 V the corresponding requirements are 1.1 V and 0.4 V.
The retained divider attenuates the valid host's 0.5 V low below even
0.4 V while preserving the 1.3 V high requirement. Use the existing
RA8P1 GPIO screen VOH >=2.5 V and VOL <=0.5 V at 1 mA magnitude with
valid host supply >=3.0 V; this is not an unpowered-host guarantee.

R7 is YAGEO RC0603FR-074K7L 4.7k; R8 remains RC0603FR-0710KL 10k.
Both are 1%, 100 ppm/C, 0.1 W at 70 C; derate above that temperature.
[Exact R7 primary specification](https://yageogroup.com/component-documentation/download/specsheet/RC0603FR-074K7L).
Use initial tolerance and a 100 C excursion: fL=.99*.99, fH=1.01*1.01.
Allocate 12 uA total adverse ON-node current, including U8, U4, host and
board; do not allocate it separately per device. Conservative separated
extrema bound both ratios and the leakage-voltage term:

The host-request bound assumes all adverse current traverses both parts;
it screens the U8 input as well as ON. Disable the host internal pull-up.
A future service mux must be checked against this load, which exceeds
100 uA; its light-load VOH guarantee cannot replace this host proof.
The divider removes the direct-drive threshold gap while the host's
specified output bounds hold. It does not prove arbitrary collapse,
unpowered GPIO behavior or ON timing relative to VIN/VOUT reversal.

### Slew, discharge and reverse-current boundaries

TPS22964C has 715 us typical 10-90% rise time at VIN=3.3 V, 25 C,
CIN=1uF, COUT=0.1uF and ROUT=10 ohm. It is not an all-corners timing
limit for this board. RADIO-020 adds C113: using 10.3uF external nominal
capacitance (C45+C46+C50+C113) only:

```text
Icap_typical_linear = 10.3uF*(0.8*3.3V)/715us = 38.030769 mA
QOD ideal RC t90..10 = R*C*ln(9)
R=273 ohm typical: t90..10 = 6.178376 ms
R=325 ohm table maximum: t90..10 = 7.355209 ms
```

The QOD maximum is specified with ON=0 and IOUT=2mA; using it in an ideal
RC screen does not guarantee a full voltage-dependent discharge waveform.
Module internal capacitance, capacitor corners, other loads and collapsing
VIN remain unresolved. C47/C49/C51 stay upstream and are not radio output
capacitance; C52 is private CT storage. No fixed off-time or reset delay
is established by these screens. Retain radio OFF during MCU cold/wake
inrush and enable only after the main rail settles. Verify the actual C6
stable-supply/reset-low interval independently using U6.

Reverse blocking is enabled only with the switch disabled and at least
one of VIN/VOUT greater than 1 V. Enabled reverse conduction is allowed.
The reverse-current table entries are typical, not a guaranteed leakage
ceiling. During abrupt main collapse, ON may remain asserted while the
radio capacitor holds VOUT above VIN; prove the total reverse charge and
ON-disable behavior, including the sub-2.5 V threshold region and loss of valid host drive. Neither
this part nor QOD establishes fast-brownout closure or substitutes for
TXU0304 isolation, complete handshake isolation, or source-fault sequencing.
The existing held KILL/EN/discharge circuit remains unchanged.

## RADIO-020: Radio-to-host status isolation

2026-09-13 work in progress, tracking #826. Native U25, C113/C114 and
R100/R101 are placed and wired on the radio sheet. Root hierarchy joins
to the MCU are exported and verified; electrical qualification remains open.

U25 is Texas Instruments TXU0102DCUR, with two forward channels. The native
Power_Devices symbol is independently editable; its footprint is deferred.
The source is [TI SCES941A, March 2022, Table 6-1 and sections 7.5, 9.4,
11](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txu0102.pdf).

| U25 pin | Native radio-sheet connection | Intended host endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 A1 | C6_DATA_READY, U3.4 GPIO4 | Through pin 8 to U1.G13/P704/IRQ26 |
| 4 A2 | C6_HANDSHAKE, U3.26 GPIO3 | Through pin 1 to U1.F17/P705/IRQ19 |
| 8 B1Y | RADIO_DATA_READY, R100.2 | U1.G13, verified in exported netlist |
| 1 B2Y | RADIO_HANDSHAKE, R101.1 | U1.F17, verified in exported netlist |
| 3 VCCA | +3V3_RADIO, C113.1 | Switched supply |
| 7 VCCB | +3V3_MCU, C114.1 | Host supply |
| 6 OE | SPI_IO_EN, U8.4/U5.8/R9.1 | Shared isolation request |
| 2 GND | Common GND | Common reference |

C113/C114 each provide 100 nF to ground. C113 raises external switched
capacitance from 10.2 to 10.3 uF; earlier RADIO-009 capacitance calculations
describe the pre-U25 circuit. RADIO-019 above contains the updated screen.
C114 is upstream. RADIO-016 now budgets 14 uA on OE; the C6_EN and
RADIO_PWR_EN node allocations remain 12 uA each.

TI specifies high impedance with OE low or either rail below 100 mV under
the specified conditions. The interval between 100 mV and valid operation
is not qualified here. Floating-supply isolation requires its separate
test conditions; a discharged island is not a floating supply. Through
125 C the listed input/three-state leakage bounds are 2 uA and zero-supply
Ioff is 2.5 uA. At 100 uA loading, output bounds are VCCB-0.1 V and 0.1 V.
Discrete input threshold tests do not prove the entire board rail range.

R100/R101 are YAGEO RC0603FR-0747KL, 47k, 1%, 100 ppm/K, grounded on
R100.1/R101.2. Their dated part sourcing is retained from the shared resistor
selection in [microSD power interface](microsd_power_interface.md).
Disable MCU internal pulls. No external bias was added to module GPIO4;
its strap loading and U25 input loading still require closure.

The following is a conditional board leakage allocation, not an installed
measurement. The 12 uA low-state screen leaves 8.5 uA beyond the assumed
2.5 uA translator and 1 uA host contributions. Validate these assumptions
for every powered/off state before using the margins as qualification.

```python
from math import isclose, log

rlo, rhi = 47000*.99*.99, 47000*1.01*1.01
vmin, vmax = 3.151819680, 3.393012496
assert isclose(rlo, 46064.7) and isclose(rhi, 47944.7)
load = vmax/rlo + 1e-6
assert isclose(load, 74.6575402857e-6) and load < 100e-6
isolated_low = (2.5e-6 + 1e-6)*rhi
allocated_low = 12e-6*rhi
assert isclose(isolated_low, .16780645)
assert isclose(allocated_low, .5753364)
assert isclose(.2*vmin-allocated_low, .055027536)
assert isclose(.2*vmin-.1, .530363936)
assert vmax**2/rlo < .001  # Conservative resistor stress below 1 mW.
assert isclose(3.6/9801+14e-6, .0003813094582185491)
cap = (0.1+10+0.1+0.1)*1e-6
assert isclose(cap, 10.3e-6)
assert isclose(cap*.8*3.3/715e-6, .03803076923076923)
assert isclose(273*cap*log(9), .006178375789011716)
assert isclose(325*cap*log(9), .007355209272632995)
print('RADIO-020 PASS: conditional arithmetic only; electrical qualification open.')
```

Firmware must mask status interrupts while isolation is requested and
reconcile the actual levels after reset and supply settling. A low caused
by isolation is not protocol readiness. Supply collapse, strap compatibility,
board leakage, edge loading and sequencing require validation; no secure
boot or protocol-ready guarantee follows from this circuit.

Native verification, 2026-09-13: the exported netlist contains the two
three-node host nets listed above and both module-to-U25 input nets.
Excluding the five new components preserves all 334 pre-existing net
partitions. ERC is 117 findings, down from 123: four unconnected-pin and
two isolated-label findings removed, no added finding identities. The
remaining 110 unconnected pins, three undriven power pins, three pin-type
conflicts and one undriven signal are still open design work.

The native RADIO-009/016/019 notes now account for C113 and U25's OE
loading. The configured native BOM export has 19 columns, 105 groups and
268 included references (TP1-TP3 remain excluded). Every included value
and manufacturer part number matches the current exported netlist, and
the net partitions remain identical to the independently reviewed circuit.
The complete 13-page PDF was refreshed and its changed overview and radio
pages inspected. A compact native RADIO-020 annotation below U25 records
the bias assumptions, equation, conditional low-level margin and open
qualification. Overview MCU-pin spacing remains a separate layout follow-up;
this radio checkpoint does not claim completion of the whole schematic.

Independent review on 2026-09-13 passed the U25 pin mapping, channel
connections, supply/OE nets, bypass and output bias, hierarchy directions,
conditional calculations and ERC delta. Its procurement-field finding was
resolved by adding native Procurement_Status and Sourcing_Snapshot fields.
