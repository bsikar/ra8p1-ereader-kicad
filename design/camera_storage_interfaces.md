# Camera, removable storage and external-memory allocation

Revision 27, 2026-09-13. Target: R7KA8P1KFLCAC#UC0, MIPI-enabled BGA289.
This is an engineering allocation record for native KiCad implementation,
not a completed schematic, verified timing closure or hardware qualification.
Cross-references: [radio](radio_interface.md), [power](system_power_design.md),
[single button](single_button_power.md), and [parts inventory](../PARTS-CHECKLIST.md).

## CMS-001: Architecture and evidence boundary

The single-camera allocation below is the historical starting point.
CMS-016 supersedes that product scope with front and rear cameras; its
unresolved CEU/audio/button conflicts must be closed before the allocation
can be called complete. CMS-014/015 retain the implemented Pcam MIPI path.

Reserve 64 MiB of 32-bit SDRAM, at least 64 MiB of soldered NOR, a separate
4-bit microSD socket, and the CU450_OV5640 camera interface in MIPI mode.
This preserves the minimum evaluation-board memory capacities without
pretending that 64 MiB of firmware/assets NOR is a GB-scale music library.
Music resides on microSD in this baseline. An additional managed eMMC is
possible, but no exact in-stock production eMMC is selected in this record.

| Function | Allocation | Reason / restriction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| External RAM | SDRAMC, 16M x 32, 64 MiB | EK capacity baseline; complete port reservation in CMS-004 |
| Soldered firmware/assets | OSPI0; reserve octal group | Existing EK firmware is part-specific; Quad alternative is not Octal performance equivalence |
| Removable music/data | SDHI1_B, four data bits, 3.3 V | Avoids SDRAM, radio and proposed SSI1_A audio |
| Camera | Two-lane MIPI CSI-2 + P501/P709/P511/P512/P010 | EK DVP mapping conflicts with SDHI1_B and radio |
| Audio coordination | SSI1_A: P907/P906/P206 | Do not reuse SSI0_A, SSI0_B or SSI1_B blindly |
| Five physical controls | Power INT P303; page P309/P310; volume P311/P909 | Independent IRQ-DS channels; CMS-009 |
| Application shutdown | POWER_KILL_N P903/D9 | NMOS-open-drain GPIO, switched VCC; BTN-009 |
| Optional managed storage | Reserve SDHI0_C, four data bits | Eight bits would consume audio P206; PD02/PD03 also replace the EK SCI8 console |

The existing [camera capture example](../../examples/ek_ra8d2/hw_validated/hil/camera_capture/README.md)
is a DVP/CEU capture path. The existing
[USB/microSD self-test](../../examples/ek_ra8d2/hw_validated/hil/usb_selftest_microsd/README.md)
uses SCI0 Simple-SPI, not native SDHI. Therefore neither example proves the
new simultaneous MIPI + native-SDHI allocation. CSI and VIN HAL source exists
in [ra8_mipi_csi.c](../../libs/ra8_hal/src/ra8_mipi_csi.c) and
[ra8_vin.c](../../libs/ra8_hal/src/ra8_vin.c); implementation is not evidence
of a validated RA8P1 capture configuration. Zephyr likewise documents only
DVP support for this shield on RA at retrieval time.
[Zephyr's CU450 shield documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/shields/arducam_cu450_ov5640/doc/index.html).

## CMS-016: Two-camera expansion and lighting requirements

Layout checkpoint, 2026-09-13: the native Pcam sheet was enlarged from A4
to A3, its existing circuit moved together toward the upper left, and a
separate five-line interface/startup note added below it. The refreshed
13-page PDF camera page was visually reviewed. All 334 exported net
partitions and all 117 ERC finding identities match the preceding radio
checkpoint; no component or pin allocation changed in this layout pass.
The overview MCU frame still needs more space; unsuccessful native resize
attempts were cancelled without saved changes to that sheet. This is a
layout checkpoint, not completion of either camera qualification or the
full schematic.

Status, 2026-09-13: required architecture revision, not a placed CEU circuit.
The owner requires front and rear cameras, front selfie illumination and a
rear flashlight. Battery power, premium audio, all five physical controls,
and the Waveshare-based display/touch/warm-cool frontlight scope remain.
The intended camera interfaces are two-lane MIPI CSI-to-VIN and parallel
CEU. Separate interfaces do not prove simultaneous capture at arbitrary
resolution or frame rate; clocks, buffering, memory arbitration and total
bandwidth need a combined budget. English HUM retrieval did not establish
a simultaneous-capture guarantee during this review.

[Renesas CEU documentation](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___c_e_u.html)
supports an 8-bit sensor on VIO_D0..D7 as well as a 16-bit camera bus.
VIO_CLK receives sensor PCLK; HD/VD receive horizontal/vertical timing.
The 16-bit-capable peripheral therefore does not require a 16-bit sensor.
Firmware control and SCCB remain separate from the capture data interface.

Independent review of the BGA289 alternatives in
[RA8P1 datasheet Rev.1.30, Table 1.17, pp26-33][cms13-ra] identifies this
8-bit route for further coordinated review:

| CEU signal | Candidate port / ball | Existing allocation affected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VIO_D0 | P206 / B15 | Former SSI1_A reservation; audio moved to SSI1_B |
| VIO_D1 | P902 / E9 | No inspected placed net |
| VIO_D2 | P909 / B14 | Volume-up relocated to P307; CEU not yet placed |
| VIO_D3 | P908 / B13 | No inspected placed net |
| VIO_D4 | P907 / A15 | Former SSI1_A reservation; audio moved to SSI1_B |
| VIO_D5 | P906 / A13 | Former SSI1_A reservation; audio moved to SSI1_B |
| VIO_D6 | P905 / A14 | No inspected placed net |
| VIO_D7 | P703 / G14 | Radio CS_N relocated to P604; CEU not yet placed |
| VIO_CLK | PB04 / D13 | No inspected placed net |
| VIO_HD | PB03 / D16 | No inspected placed net |
| VIO_VD | PB02 / E13 | No inspected placed net |

P312/C13 is deliberately excluded: CMS-009 records a conflict between
its datasheet listing and HUM Table 21.10 availability for MIPI289. An
unconnected symbol pin does not resolve that manufacturer-document issue.

The coordinated candidate moves the radio transport from SPIA_C to
SCI0 Simple SPI, freeing SSI1_B for the complete existing audio function.
Only five already connected MCU signals move: radio clock, COPI, CIPO,
CS_N and volume-up. The three audio pins are reservation changes, not
removal of the DAC/headphone/speaker/USB-DAC requirements.

| Function | Candidate port / ball | Alternate / direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio BCLK | P702 / F13 | SSIBCK1_B, input from DAC |
| Audio LRCLK | P701 / F15 | SSILRCK1_B, input from DAC |
| Audio data | P700 / F12 | SSIDATA1_B, output |
| RADIO_SCLK | P601 / P4 | SCK0_B, SCI0 clock output |
| RADIO_COPI | P603 / P1 | MOSI0_B, SCI0 output |
| RADIO_CIPO | P602 / P2 | MISO0_B, SCI0 input |
| RADIO_CS_N | P604 / N2 | GPIO output; software-controlled select |
| VOL_UP_N | P307 / C11 | IRQ27-DS input; disable trace function |

The other four controls remain POWER_BUTTON_N P303/B6 IRQ29-DS,
PAGE_PREV_N P309/A12 IRQ25-DS, PAGE_NEXT_N P310/E10 IRQ24-DS and
VOL_DOWN_N P311/B12 IRQ23-DS. Radio READY P704/G13 IRQ26,
HANDSHAKE P705/F17 IRQ19, reset request P706/E17 and power request
P707/F16 remain. Disable alternate IRQ routing on the SCI/GPIO-CS pins,
particularly IRQ27 on P603, IRQ29 on P601 and IRQ26 on P604; those
channels already belong to the selected button/radio inputs.

Read-only Python comparison against the recovered native XML on
2026-09-13 found the CEU8, SSI1_B, SCI0, five-button, retained radio-control
and camera groups mutually disjoint. The only occupied balls reassigned
are B14, F12, F13, F15 and G14. SDRAM, NOR and microSD connections
remain, including P708/N12 SD_IO_REQ. Existing MIPI contacts and camera
SCCB P512/P13 and P511/U15, control P709/P16, and P501/R8/P010/P10
reservations remain. This is a candidate net-allocation check, not evidence
that the revised connections are placed or that every remaining product
function has an assigned pin.

[Renesas SCI_B SPI documentation][cms16-sci] explicitly supports RA8P1,
full-duplex transfers, both clock polarities/phases and DMA. In controller
mode CS must be driven in software. SCI0 here is hardware Simple SPI,
not a UART or bit-banged replacement. Preserve the radio's initial 5MHz
evaluation target, isolation and handshake protocol, but recalculate its
SCI receive/setup and round-trip timing, clock divider, DMA priorities
and cache-coherency contract. SPIA timing evidence does not automatically
transfer to SCI0. SSI1_B must retain the DAC-supplied clock direction and
the existing audio frequency/format limits.

The candidate retains switched +3V3_MCU logic supplies: current VCC and
VCC2 both connect to that rail, while the MIPI PHY retains its separate
+1V8_MIPI supply. It creates no AON_HOLD load. This supply observation
does not substitute for checking each revised pin's VCC/VCC2/analog-bank
classification, drive strength, Schmitt thresholds and powered-off limits
against current HUM electrical tables. Recheck the unchanged button RC
screen for P307 and confirm its deep-standby enable/flag selection; the
IRQ27-DS datasheet entry alone is not a complete wake implementation.
The English HUM retrieval limitation remains explicit.

Independent placement review, 2026-09-13: GO for the five listed MCU
connectivity changes. RA8P1 datasheet Table 2.6
pp51-52 explicitly classifies P307 as VCC and P600..P607 as VCC2; both
native supplies presently connect to +3V3_MCU. P307 is a non-5V-tolerant
Schmitt input with the existing 1uA leakage allocation. Re-executed CMS-009
button calculations retain low maximum 0.341555V, minimum low margin
0.315032V and high minimum 2.977558V. Keep the external filter/pullup and
disable the internal pull and trace output.

Renesas's [RA8P1 device header][cms16-header] corroborates IRQ27 wake
enable DPSIER5.DIRQ27E bit 3 and flag DPSIFR5.DIRQ27F bit 3, but edge
selection is DPSIEGR4.DIRQ27EG bit 3. Do not infer an edge register 5
from the enable/flag register numbers. The [LPM API][cms16-lpm-api]
defines falling edge as zero and rising edge as one; the
[LPM implementation][cms16-lpm] reads flags before writing zero.
Preserve other wake sources and handle a key already held before sleep.
This corroborates the allocation; full HUM sequencing and bench wake
verification remain open. SCI receive timing and drive/edge qualification
also remain open and cannot inherit the SPIA timing signoff.

Native migration checkpoint, 2026-09-13: all four radio bus signals have
moved to the reviewed SCI0/GPIO group, using aligned 300mil stubs and
50mil left-facing hierarchical labels. Exported XML confirms these exact
two-node nets: SCLK U1.P4/U5.2, CIPO U1.P2/U5.5, COPI U1.P1/U5.3,
and CS_N U1.N2/U5.4. Former balls F13/F12/F15/G14 are isolated pending
audio/CEU implementation. Read-only partition comparison proves exactly
these four MCU substitutions, retaining every other net membership and
all component/library records (U1 unit UUID order is normalized without
changing its set). There are 334 nets. Native and CLI ERC remain 122 findings:
120 errors and two warnings, with unchanged type counts. The MCU note
now describes CMS-016 and links here. The complete two-camera allocation and SCI timing,
isolation, reset behavior and hardware operation remain unqualified.
Independent read-only review passed the four-substitution scope, all 266
component records, 35 library parts, 13 libraries, the net partition and
the matching native/documented allocation. This does not close the
remaining product-level allocation or electrical qualifications.

Volume-up migration checkpoint, 2026-09-13: VOL_UP_N now joins U1.C11
(P307_IN, Input), C61.1, R26.2 and R30.2. B14 is isolated for future
CEU VIO_D2. The native MCU library defines default P307 as Bidirectional
and its selected P307_IN alternate as Input; every placed U1 unit cache
was synchronized while preserving fields and other selected functions.
Read-only XML partition comparison against the radio checkpoint proves
exactly the B14-to-C11 substitution and the exchanged isolated pin, with
all other memberships unchanged across 334 nets. All 266 component and
13 library records remain unchanged after normalizing U1 unit UUID order.
The only changed library pin record is C11's corrected default type.
Native and CLI ERC now agree at 123 findings (121 errors, two warnings): the added
pin_not_driven finding is the freed B14 input awaiting its CEU connection.
It is retained, not suppressed. Independent read-only review passed all
five substitutions, the unchanged records, all four synchronized MCU
library caches, the selected input alternate and the exact ERC delta.
The four ignored ERC checks remain unchanged. These five placed moves do not qualify
the unimplemented second camera or the revised peripheral timing.

Review-output checkpoint, 2026-09-13: root and MCU allocation pages are
now A2 landscape. The core/analog root blocks occupy separate lower areas;
the MCU C39 note is larger, left-aligned and separated below the circuit.
Camera R98 reference/value now sit left of the resistor, clear of R99.
All 13 PDF pages were rendered and visually reviewed; the root MCU
hierarchical block still needs further spacing, so this is not final layout
acceptance. Native BOM export contains 103 grouped rows, 19 columns and
263 included components; TP1..TP3 retain their explicit BOM exclusions.
Read-only comparison after these layout edits preserves all 334 net
partitions and 266 component records, with ERC still 121 errors/two warnings.

Other VIO_D2 choices consume microSD DAT3 or SDRAM A6. A 16-bit route
additionally conflicts with page/volume controls or radio/SDRAM. Display,
illumination and service reservations remain incomplete. Complete their
combined allocation before calling the system pin plan closed; do not
delete buttons or reduce audio functionality to make CEU fit.

Adafruit 5840 OV5640 autofocus breakout is a candidate for a parallel
interface audit, not a selected production BOM item. Its
[manufacturer pinout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ov5640-camera-breakout/pinouts)
describes 3.3V board power, eight data outputs D2..D9, PCLK, HS, VS,
SCCB, reset/power-down and external/onboard clock options. Map its D2..D9
to CEU D0..D7 only after the exact board revision, voltage limits, current,
off-state behavior, clock configuration, autofocus and connector are
qualified. Two OV5640 modules require independently addressable control
paths or a qualified SCCB mux/address arrangement.

Independent assembly review, 2026-09-13: the
[Adafruit Eagle schematic](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-OV5640-Camera-Breakout-PCB)
establishes this JP2 physical-pad map for the exact 5840 breakout. These
are reviewed interface candidates, not placed nets or a completed power design.

| JP2 contact | Assembly signal | Proposed host connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 / 2 | 3.3V / GND | Qualified camera supply / GND |
| 3 / 4 | SCL / SDA | Independent second-camera SCCB path |
| 5 | VSYNC | PB02/E13, CEU VD |
| 6 | HREF | PB03/D16, CEU HD |
| 7 | PCLK | PB04/D13, CEU CLK |
| 8 | External XCLK | NC with onboard INT clock selected |
| 9 | DATA9 | P703/G14, CEU D7 |
| 10 | DATA8 | P905/A14, CEU D6 |
| 11 | DATA7 | P906/A13, CEU D5 |
| 12 | DATA6 | P907/A15, CEU D4 |
| 13 | DATA5 | P908/B13, CEU D3 |
| 14 | DATA4 | P909/B14, CEU D2 |
| 15 | DATA3 | P902/E9, CEU D1 |
| 16 | DATA2 | P206/B15, CEU D0 |
| 17 / 18 | RESET_N / PWDN | Separate controlled outputs; allocation open |

The onboard oscillator is 24MHz; selecting it requires cutting EXT and
bridging INT. RESET_N has a 10k pullup and 100nF; PWDN has a 10k
pulldown, so the untouched assembly defaults enabled. Explicitly design
reset/powerdown arbitration. Its SCCB pullups are 10k to camera supply,
and PCLK already has 22pF. Include that loading in the interconnect budget.
The [5840 product requirements](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5840)
also require VM jumper closure and autofocus firmware. Motor current,
acquisition current and inrush are not yet bounded. STROBE is a test pad,
not a JP2 contact; the front light needs a separate driver and control.

The [Adafruit driver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_OV5640/main/adafruit_ov5640/__init__.py)
defaults to 7-bit SCCB address 0x3C, colliding with Pcam. Its address
argument does not demonstrate a programmable hardware address. A separate
bus or qualified mux must also resolve powered-off injection from pullups
and host-driven control pins. PWDN does not disconnect board input power.

Production qualification gap: Adafruit specifies regulated 3.3V board
operation and connects DOVDD directly to that input. However, its genuine
[OmniVision OV5640 v2.03 datasheet, Table 8-3, printed p8-2](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/118/994/original/OV5640_datasheet.pdf?1677598686=)
lists 3.0V maximum VDD-IO. This discrepancy requires assembly-specific
manufacturer clarification; it does not establish that the sold module
fails. Do not declare the proposed 3.1518..3.3930V rail envelope qualified
or substitute bare-sensor figures for assembly current, temperature,
logic-level and sequencing limits. A separately linked Leopard
LI-OV5640-MIPI-AF document describes a different assembly and cannot close
these requirements. Signal planning can continue while power qualification
remains open.

Procurement snapshot, 2026-09-13, unreserved: Adafruit 5840 lists 15 stock,
USD 9.95/8.96/7.96 at 1/10/100; [DigiKey 1528-5840-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/5840/22163377)
lists Active, 134 stock, four-week lead and USD 9.95 at one. This is not
a production BOM selection or purchase authorization.

Provide four independently controlled lighting functions: warm display,
cool display, front camera illumination and rear flashlight. Front/rear
visible LEDs need regulated current, hardware default-off/reset inhibition,
separate continuous and pulsed limits, and source/thermal budgets. Camera
light does not replace the panel light guide. Infrared/depth sensing for
face authentication remains an investigation; ordinary RGB capture and
visible illumination do not establish spoof-resistant authentication.
The existing SYS-010 single-camera current screen excludes the second
camera and both camera lights and must not be treated as the new maximum.

## CMS-002: Exact camera module and connector contract

Procurement correction, 2026-09-12: Renesas staff confirms that CU450 was
designed for Renesas and is not sold separately. Retain the following as
the EK reference contract, not a production purchasing instruction.
[Renesas verified support answer](https://community.renesas.com/mcu/ra/f/forum/60538/regarding-buying-an-arducam-0v5640-cu450-cmos-5mp-mipi-csi-2-camera).
CMS-014 below evaluates the independently orderable Pcam 5C alternative;
CMS-015 records the later host-connector/control leaf placement and six
CSI hierarchy joins, followed by all three MCU control joins. Camera
qualification remains pending.

The historical allocation used **Arducam CU450_OV5640**, the 36 x 40 mm Camera Expansion Board named in
the [EK-RA8P1 v1 manual, Rev.1.04, section 3 and Table 36](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mat/ek-ra8p1-v1-users-manual).
This identifies the module and its actual 40-contact interface. The raw
OV5640 sensor datasheet does not define that connector. B0156, B0530,
OV5647 Raspberry Pi cameras, and arbitrary OV5640 breakout boards are not
pin-compatible substitutes without their own complete connector audit.

The following is the EK Table 36 MIPI-mode contract, visually checked
against the original PDF. Contact numbers are module-interface numbers,
not a promise about an unselected FFC connector's top/bottom contact side.

| Module contact(s) | Net/function | RA8P1 port / BGA289 ball |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 / 6 | CAM_DL1_P / CAM_DL1_N | Dedicated MIPI_DL1_P T3 / MIPI_DL1_N U3 |
| 8 / 9 | CAM_CL_P / CAM_CL_N | Dedicated MIPI_CL_P T2 / MIPI_CL_N U2 |
| 11 / 12 | CAM_DL0_P / CAM_DL0_N | Dedicated MIPI_DL0_P T1 / MIPI_DL0_N U1 |
| 20 | Camera SCL | P512 / P13, SCL1_A |
| 21 | Camera SDA | P511 / U15, SDA1_A |
| 25 | Camera reset | P709 / P16, GPIO |
| 26 | Camera XCLK | P501 / R8, GTIOC12A |
| 28 | Camera interrupt | P010 / P10, IRQ14 |
| 31, 34, 35, 36, 39 | Module +3.3 V | Camera supply domain; qualify peak current and sequencing |
| 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 29, 30, 32, 33, 37, 38, 40 | GND | Common ground |
| 2, 3, 14, 15, 17, 18, 23, 24, 27 | Unused in MIPI mode | Intentional no-connect on host |

The MCU additionally needs VCC18_MIPI at R2 (1.65..1.95 V), AVCC_MIPI
at T4 (2.90..3.60 V), and VSS_MIPI at R3 (GND). Remove any prior no-connect
markers from those supply/PHY pins when implementing this function.
The [RA8P1 datasheet](../../docs/reference/ra8p1-datasheet.pdf), Table 2.44,
specifies supply rise gradients in **us/V**, not V/us. A separate qualified
1.8 V supply, decoupling, ramp/sequence review and CSI clock calculation are
required; a global power label alone does not create that rail.

The module shares its differential contacts with DVP pins. Select MIPI in
the sensor configuration; do not wire both operating modes simultaneously.
The existing DVP setup's nominal 24 MHz XCLK, reset low/high delays and
SCCB transaction path are useful bring-up evidence, not a complete MIPI
sensor-register program. The PHY is shared with MIPI-DSI, so this allocation
precludes a simultaneous MIPI-DSI display; the e-paper interface does not
need DSI. Signal polarity and clock/data lane ordering are fixed above.

Production gates: obtain exact CU450 orderability, module revision/schematic,
power consumption and FFC/cable mating contract. An independently purchasable
CU450 listing with current DigiKey/Mouser stock was not verified. The EK
module supports prototyping, but this record does not authorize buying an
unverified camera or inferring its internal regulators. For camera power
gating, address SCCB pullups and every clock/control back-power path; pulling
RESET low is not equivalent to removing power safely.

## CMS-014: Pcam 5C module implementation candidate

Digilent **410-358**, Pcam 5C, supplies an OV5640 with two MIPI lanes.
This is the next implementation candidate, subject to the electrical and
cable checks below. The selected RA8P1 package and dedicated lane allocation
remain unchanged. The MCU host supply is already implemented under CMS-013;
the camera module's 3.3V demand is additional.

[Digilent's manual](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Digilent%20PDFs/Pcam_5C_RefManual_Web.pdf)
specifies 3.0..3.6V, 200mA maximum, SCCB up to 400kHz with 1.5k host
pullups, and a 12MHz onboard clock. Its module-side J1 contract is:

| J1 contact | Function | Proposed RA8P1 endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 / 3 | Lane 0 N / P | U1 / T1 |
| 5 / 6 | Lane 1 N / P | U3 / T3 |
| 8 / 9 | Clock N / P | U2 / T2 |
| 13 / 14 | SCL / SDA | P512/P13 / P511/U15 |
| 11 | PWUP | P709/P16, subject to hardware default/clear circuit |
| 15 | 3.3V input | Qualified camera supply |
| 1 / 4 / 7 / 10 | Ground | GND |
| 12 | NC | Explicit no-connect |

Use host connector candidate **TE 1-1734248-5**, matching J2 on
[Digilent Zybo Z7 D.1 sheet 2](https://files.digilent.com/resources/programmable-logic/zybo-z7/zybo-z7-d1-sch.pdf).
[Zybo manual Table 15.1 and installation instructions](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/programmable-logic/zybo-z7/zybo-z7_rm.pdf)
give the same numbered functions as Pcam J1. The documented installation
therefore connects host contact n to module contact n, not 16-n.
[Wurth 686715100001 drawing](https://www.we-online.com/components/products/datasheet/686715100001.pdf),
Rev.001.003 dated 2026-06-03, identifies the schematic's 100mm cable as
15-conductor, 1.00mm pitch, Type 2 with opposite exposed ends.
The TE connector is vertical and single-sided, accepting 0.30+/-0.05mm
flex. Follow the [TE drawing Rev.E1](https://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=srchrtrv&DocFormat=pdf&DocLang=English&DocNm=1734248&DocType=Customer+Drawing&PartCntxt=1-1734248-5)
circuit-one mark when creating the
native symbol and later qualifying the footprint; do not infer numbering
from a generic connector image. Module-end exposed contacts face its PCB;
the Zybo host-end contacts face away from that board's center. The new
board's assembly instructions must translate these references to its own
orientation. P501/R8 external XCLK
and P010/P10 interrupt are unnecessary for the basic Pcam interface; keep
their earlier reservations until the replacement is actually integrated.
The camera firmware must adapt its PLL setup to 12MHz and PWUP timing
(low at least 100ms, then high at least 50ms before SCCB access). Existing
EK 24MHz setup is not a compatible binary configuration.

[Digilent schematic 500-358 C.0](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/add-ons/pcam-5c/pcam_5c_sch.pdf)
identifies GTL2002 SCCB translation, LP5907 1.8V/2.8V regulators and
onboard reset sequencing. PWUP is a regulator-enable control, not a
separate sensor reset. Host pullups, module translator bias, and PHY
collapse sequencing require independent off-state review; do not infer
zero backfeed from the presence of onboard regulators. No raw-sensor
supply circuit is being substituted for this module.

The host control candidate is SN74LVC1G97 configured as camera request
AND MCU_RESET_N, with request and PWUP pulldowns. This addresses the
[LP5907](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lp5907.pdf) EN-low limit of
0.4V versus the 0.5V host GPIO-low allowance. The
[logic gate](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc1g97.pdf) specifies
0.1V maximum low at 100uA; verify the complete input/leakage load and
reset fanout under CMS-015's allocation. Its common reset connection is
now integrated, as are the six CSI signals, request and SCCB controls.
[GTL2002 function tables](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/GTL2002.pdf)
support translator isolation with SREF at zero. A separately switched
module supply is therefore not inherently required for commanded off,
but the transition while its 1.8V supply decays still needs review.
LP5907's 230-ohm discharge value is typical, not a guaranteed shutdown
deadline. Require camera transmitter-off before host PHY power removal;
unexpected collapse needs a qualified timing/hold-up contract.

Source snapshot, 2026-09-12: [DigiKey 1286-1191-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/digilent-inc/410-358/8111762)
lists Active, 376 units, four-week manufacturer lead time and USD53 at
quantity one, excluding tax/shipping. Stock is not reserved. The June 2,
2026 [Digilent regional-availability PCN](https://www.mouser.com/PCN/Digilent_Inc_Digilent_EMC_PCN_3871911_Product_availability_table_%281%29.pdf)
identifies non-US restrictions and does not identify a US restriction.
Confirm acceptance for any non-US destination; an Active listing alone
is not a worldwide procurement approval.

The same dated [DigiKey host-connector listing, A101418CT-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/1-1734248-5/2272380)
shows Active, 25,233 units, eight-week manufacturer lead time and
USD1.49 / 1.268 / 1.0772 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100.
These are procurement records for the later CMS-015 leaf placement;
refreshed full-project BOM reconciliation remains pending.

The 200mA camera allocation must be added to the CMS-013 2.095A main-rail
screen if powered there. Before host pullups and any new interface logic,
the tentative total becomes 2.295A. Applying the same modeled conversion
conditions as SYS-010 gives the following deliberately incomplete budget:

```python
from math import isclose
camera_a = .200
digital_a = 2.095 + camera_a
source_a = (digital_a * 3.393012496197 / .75 + 2.892695047520901) / 3.2
assert isclose(digital_a, 2.295)
assert source_a > 4
print('tentative digital A / source subtotal A', digital_a, source_a)
```

Executed result: 4.148535402A source subtotal at 3.2V.
This is a source-budget screen, not converter qualification or a measured
peak. It already exceeds the initial 4A source allocation before the
remaining audio, display and front-light loads. Complete SYS-010's pack,
harness and thermal review before increasing that allocation.

## CMS-015: Pcam control, reset loading and SCCB screens

Status, 2026-09-13: the inspected camera working XML contains U24
**SN74LVC1G97DBVR**, R96/R97 10k, R98/R99 1.5k and C112 100n.
The earlier DCKR proposal is not the native selection. J3 is the host
connector. The reset connection is now integrated through the hierarchy.
The request and SCCB signals now join their MCU ports through the root
hierarchy, as verified in the control integration checkpoint below.
This does not establish electrical qualification, refreshed PDF/BOM
acceptance or successful capture.

CSI integration checkpoint, 2026-09-13: all six MCU-side no-connect
markers have been replaced in the native editor by short wires and
input hierarchical labels. Matching root sheet pins, wire stubs and
local labels now join the camera to the MCU. Exported-netlist checks
and independent review confirm exactly these two-contact nets:

| MCU input port | U1 BGA contact | Joined camera connector contact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CAM_CLK_N | U2 | J3.8 |
| CAM_CLK_P | T2 | J3.9 |
| CAM_D0_N | U1 | J3.2 |
| CAM_D0_P | T1 | J3.3 |
| CAM_D1_N | U3 | J3.5 |
| CAM_D1_P | T3 | J3.6 |

All 266 component records and 35 library-part records are unchanged by
these root joins. Independent netlist comparison confirms exactly six
net unions (343 to 337 nets), with every other net and the eight-contact
common reset preserved. Native and all-severity CLI ERC agree at
126 errors and 2 warnings. Compared with the 152-finding parent-port
checkpoint, exactly six unconnected sheet-pin errors and 18 isolated
label warnings are removed; there are no new findings. The four ignored
tests are unchanged. Remaining ERC work is not waived.

The root page is now A2 landscape. MCU supply blocks occupy a separate
row, and the camera block has space for six aligned 500mil wire stubs
and 50mil labels at 100mil pitch. All 272 root object UUIDs are unique.
The crowded MCU root block still requires layout work; refreshed native
BOM and full PDF review remain required before phase acceptance.

Historical MCU control-leaf checkpoint, 2026-09-13: native wires and 50mil
hierarchical labels now connect CAM_PWR_REQ to P709/P16 (output),
CAM_SDA to P511/U15 and CAM_SCL to P512/P13 (bidirectional). These
are still separate from the camera leaf. The exported XML retains
266 components, 337 nets and exactly the previous net memberships.
CLI ERC is 131 findings: the three unused MCU-pin errors are replaced
by three missing-parent-pin errors and three isolated-label warnings;
every other finding is unchanged. Manual root port placement and joins
remain required. An automatic root import was undone because it moved
the sheet boundary and left 11 wire ends dangling; the saved checkpoint
has no such wire-end findings.

Control integration checkpoint, 2026-09-13: manual native root ports
and labeled wire stubs now join all three control nets. MCU parent
ports are spaced at 200mil pitch; camera-side stubs are 500mil long
with 50mil labels. The MCU filename and nearby NOR_CK_HOST text have
been repositioned to clear the control group.

| Joined net | Exact component contacts |
| --- | --- |
| CAM_PWR_REQ | U1.P16, R96.1, U24.3 |
| CAM_SCL | U1.P13, J3.13, R98.1 |
| CAM_SDA | U1.U15, J3.14, R99.1 |

Read-only XML comparison confirms exactly these three net unions
(337 to 334 nets). Every other node partition and all 266 component
records, library parts and library records remain unchanged. Native and
CLI ERC agree at 122 findings (120 errors, 2 warnings), down from the 131-finding
leaf checkpoint: three hierarchy mismatches, three unconnected pins
and three isolated labels are removed. No wire-end errors appear.
The MCU overview still needs more space; this checkpoint does not
constitute complete layout, electrical qualification, or PDF/BOM acceptance.

The dedicated IIC1 assignment was independently reviewed against
[RA8P1 Rev.1.30 Tables 1.17, 2.5 and 2.7][cms13-ra]. Retain
ICFER.FMPE=1 for the modeled pullup load, with SCCB clock at most
400kHz. The guaranteed 15mA sink row applies to SCL1_A/SDA1_A;
the 20mA typical row is not the acceptance limit. P709 uses ordinary
low drive, with its output latch initialized low before enabling the
output. Sensor-side VOL, bus timing, leakage and rail-collapse behavior
remain qualification items. CMS-016 preserves these three assignments.

Independent review of the reset-stage XML confirms /MCU_RESET_N contains
exactly J1.10, R1.2, U1.D5, U15.A4, U19.6, U2.6, U24.6 and U7.3;
the separate camera-leaf reset net no longer exists. ERC falls from 143
to 140 findings: the unconnected reset sheet pin, isolated reset label
and undriven U24.6 input are removed. Recreating the parent sheet block
changed nine remaining camera sheet-pin UUIDs/positions; those are the
same unconnected-port findings, not new electrical regressions. Comparison
by sheet, severity, type and item description finds only the three reset
removals, no additions; all other retained finding details and ignored
checks are unchanged. Remaining ERC work is not waived.

| U24 pin | Leaf connection |
| --- | --- |
| 1 IN1, 2 GND | GND |
| 3 IN0 | CAM_PWR_REQ; R96.1, with R96.2 to GND |
| 4 Y | J3.11 PWUP and R97.1; R97.2 to GND |
| 5 VCC | +3V3_MCU; C112 to GND |
| 6 IN2 | MCU_RESET_N; verified common-reset join |

[TI SCES416N, sections 5/6.5/8.4][cms15-gate] establishes this pin map
and Y = IN0 AND IN2 when IN1 is grounded. R96/R97 are YAGEO
RC0603FR-0710KL; the 1% initial and 100ppm/C, 100C excursion model gives
9801..10201 ohm. The 100C excursion is an arithmetic assumption, not
whole-module temperature qualification. No extra pull is added to reset.

### Shared MIPI PHY pin types

The project BGA289 symbol `R7KA8P1KFLCAC#UC0` now represents all six
MIPI contacts as bidirectional, and the targeted U1 library update is
saved: CL_N U2, CL_P T2, DL0_N U1, DL0_P T1, DL1_N U3 and DL1_P T3.
This is an engineering representation of selectable DSI transmit and
CSI receive functions. The current camera hierarchy uses input ports
at the MCU boundary to express the intended CSI receiver configuration;
it does not make these silicon contacts dedicated receiver-only pins.

[RA8P1 datasheet R01DS0439EJ0130, Rev.1.30, Table 1.16, p19][cms13-ra]
describes the contacts as DSI/CSI. Its direction column lists clock and
data lane 1 as output, and data lane 0 as I/O. That DSI-oriented column
does not establish unconditional input-only behavior for CSI. The
[quick guide, sections 17.1-17.3][cms15-phy-guide] describes mutually
exclusive DSI and CSI use, with DSI transmission and CSI reception.
The currently served R01AN7883EU0110 Rev.1.10 is titled RA8x2 MCU Quick
Design Guide (printed pp77-79); the earlier RA8P1 Rev.1.00 section 17.3
also identifies CSI reception. The RA8P1 datasheet remains the
device-specific pin reference.

Bidirectional preserves the selectable active PHY capability instead
of hiding it behind passive pin types. It is not a claim that every
lane supports reverse traffic while CSI is selected. This review did
not retrieve the English HUM successfully and therefore does not
certify every CSI low-power/escape state as receive-only. Firmware
must retain the intended CSI mode; pin typing does not close signal
integrity, power sequencing, off-state or capture qualification.

### Reset and PWUP default model

Before camera integration, [RST-002](reset_coordination_tps3890.md) and
CMS-011C allocate MCU 5uA + U7 5uA + NOR 2uA + U19 5uA = 17uA.
U24 was not reserved: add 5uA, yielding 22uA devices. Preserve the 13uA
overhead for supervisor, board, debugger and other adverse leakage,
giving **35uA for the current reset-integrated circuit**. The preceding
30uA CMS-011C/RST-002 calculations describe the pre-camera baseline;
this section supersedes that loading screen for the added U24 input.
The total is an acceptance allocation, not a guaranteed current sum.

The gate's +/-5uA input limit uses VI=0 or 5.5V and VCC=0..5.5V;
Ioff is separately +/-10uA at VCC=0. Its input capacitance is 3.5pF
typical, not a maximum. Do not extend these conditions through arbitrary
partial power. At VCC=3.0V, VT+ maximum is 1.87V and VT- minimum is
0.84V; threshold rows at discrete supplies do not prove an interpolated
continuous-rail bound. Retain reset edge/fanout qualification.

[LP5907 SNVS798Q][cms15-ldo] specifies EN low <=0.4V and high >=1.2V
for VIN=2.2..5.5V. U24's VOL<=0.1V at <=100uA, VCC=1.65..5.5V,
avoids relying on the host's 0.5V GPIO-low allowance. Verify complete
module/board current into PWUP remains within that sink test. At VCC=3V,
the gate's VOH>=2.4V at 16mA supports a separate high-state test-point
screen; R97 alone draws up to 0.3462mA, so the 100uA VOH row does not
apply. Module enable/RC loads and charging transients must be included.

Allocate 10uA adverse request leakage (MCU plus gate) and 20uA adverse
PWUP leakage for default-state screens. These are acceptance budgets,
including board/module effects where relevant, not published module
maxima. Disable internal MCU pulls. No guarantee is made below valid
gate supply or for a missing/unpowered module with external injection.

```python
from math import isclose

vhi, vlo = 3.393012496197, 3.151819680
vfall = 3.000822726706337
rmin, rmax = 10000*.99*.99, 10000*1.01*1.01
reset_devices = (5+5+2+5+5)*1e-6
reset_total = reset_devices + 13e-6
reset_sink = vhi/rmin + reset_total
reset_high = vlo - reset_total*rmax
reset_margin = reset_high - .8*vlo
fall_high = vfall - reset_total*rmax
fall_margin = fall_high - .8*vfall
gate_3v_margin = 3.0 - reset_total*rmax - 1.87
assert isclose(reset_devices, 22e-6)
assert isclose(reset_total, 35e-6)
assert reset_sink < .0004
assert isclose(reset_high, 2.794784680)
assert isclose(reset_margin, .273328936)
request_default = 10e-6*rmax
pwup_default = 20e-6*rmax
assert request_default < .35 and pwup_default < .4
print('CMS-015 current reset sink A / high V / MCU margin V',
      reset_sink, reset_high, reset_margin)
print('fall high / MCU margin / separate 3V gate margin V',
      fall_high, fall_margin, gate_3v_margin)
print('additional reset drop V / sink headroom A',
      5e-6*rmax, .0004-reset_sink)
print('request / PWUP allocated defaults V', request_default, pwup_default)
```

Executed results: sink 0.381190439mA, leaving 18.809561uA below the
0.4mA test load; high 2.794784680V and MCU margin 0.273328936V.
At the falling corner, high is 2.643787727V and margin 0.243129545V.
The added drop is 51.005mV. At the separate 3V gate point the high margin
is 0.772965V. Request/PWUP allocated defaults are 0.10201/0.20402V.
Reported decimals are rounded results, not outward-rounded guarantee
inequalities. U2's <=0.25V low at VDD>=1.5V and 0.4mA supports only
the stated static sink screen, not low-POR or collapse behavior.

### SCCB pullup current and timing model

R98.2/R99.2 connect to +3V3_MCU; R98.1 and J3.13 form CAM_SCL,
R99.1 and J3.14 form CAM_SDA. Use 1.5k host pulls as required by the
[Pcam manual][cms15-manual]. The module schematic also has 1.5k pulls
to its 1.8V rail, so a sinking device sees both sides through GTL2002.
The screen below assumes the module pull resistors meet the host's
1%/100ppm grade and its 1.8V rail stays within +2%; those combined
module bounds require confirmation and are not established by resistor
values on the schematic alone. The host selected MPN is
[RC0603FR-071K5L][cms15-r15].

[RA8P1 Table 2.7][cms13-ra] specifies IIC VOL<=0.4V at 3mA,
or <=0.6V at 6mA. The modeled 0.4V load slightly exceeds 3mA.
Configure the dedicated IIC with ICFER.FMPE=1 to use its <=0.4V at
15mA specification, VCC>=2.7V; do not use the generic GPIO 1mA screen.
The Pcam manual does not establish sensor sink/VIL limits or combined
translator drop. Obtain those limits and verify both directions.

```python
from math import log, isclose

rpmin, rpmax = 1500*.99*.99, 1500*1.01*1.01
vhost, vcam = 3.393012496197, 1.8*1.02
sink_zero = (vhost+vcam)/rpmin
sink_04 = (vhost+vcam-2*.4)/rpmin
# Host-side lumped 30%-70% RC rise model, not translated-bus closure.
cap_300ns = 300e-9/(log(7/3)*rpmax)
cap_1000ns = 1e-6/(log(7/3)*rpmax)
assert .003 < sink_04 < sink_zero < .015
assert isclose(cap_300ns, 231.39349105849004e-12)
print('CMS-015 conditional zero/0.4V sink mA', sink_zero*1e3, sink_04*1e3)
print('host RC capacitance at 300ns / 1000ns pF',
      cap_300ns*1e12, cap_1000ns*1e12)
```

Executed current screens are 3.556788/3.012626mA. The
[TI pullup derivation][cms15-rise] gives tr=ln(7/3)*R*C, hence
231.393491pF for 300ns and 771.311637pF for 1000ns in this model.
These are not permissions to exceed other bus capacitance limits.
Include cable, connector, protection, receiver and translator capacitance;
verify both translated waveforms, VOL, high level and edge timing at the
chosen <=400kHz rate. GTL2002's test-point Ron/capacitance values are not
a complete sensor/host timing or voltage-margin proof.

### Off-state and power-budget boundary

[GTL2002 Tables 4/5][cms15-gtl] support static isolation with SREF=0;
this supports using the module's own PWUP-controlled LDOs for commanded
off without inherently requiring another supply switch. LP5907's 230-ohm
discharge is typical-only and it lacks dedicated UVLO. Keep the host PHY
powered while stopping capture and lowering PWUP; establish transmitter
off before removing host PHY power. Unexpected main collapse still needs
measured/qualified rail ordering or a revised isolation/hold-up circuit.
Neither the gate nor static translator table supplies that timing proof.
Use the manual's >=100ms PWUP-low reset and >=50ms high-before-SCCB
policy with qualified host rails; those waits do not prove fault shutdown.

CMS-014's 2.295A main subtotal and 4.148535402A source screen exclude
the new host pulls, gate and dynamic interface load. Account for these
without adding the module's internal pull current twice to its 200mA
allocation. Do not increase the 4A source allocation without SYS-010's
remaining pack/harness/thermal review. No firmware change is claimed.

## CMS-003: microSD native connection and a repository mismatch

Reserve the entire SDHI1_B six-signal bus. The BGA289 assignment is checked
against [RA8P1 Table 1.17](../../docs/reference/ra8p1-datasheet.pdf) and also
[RA8D2 Table 1.16](../../docs/reference/ra8d2-datasheet.pdf), Rev.1.30,
2026-02-27. P400/P401 appear on printed page 32 in both datasheets.

| Signal | Port / ball | DM3AT-SF-PEJM5 contact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SD1CLK_B | P400 / P17 | 5 CLK |
| SD1CMD_B | P401 / N17 | 3 CMD |
| SD1DAT0_B | P402 / L14 | 7 DAT0 |
| SD1DAT1_B | P403 / H13 | 8 DAT1 |
| SD1DAT2_B | P404 / J13 | 1 DAT2 |
| SD1DAT3_B | P405 / G12 | 2 DAT3 |
| SD1CD | P406 / F14 | MP2 CD_B; MP4 CD_A to GND |
| Card supply / ground | Qualified +3.3 V / GND | 4 VDD / 6 VSS |

The socket's A/B detect switch is separate from its eight card contacts.
The project symbol `Connectors:DM3AT-SF-PEJM5` now names MP2 `CD_B`,
MP4 `CD_A`, and MP1/MP3/MP5/MP6 `SHIELD1`..`SHIELD4`. Ground all four
shield pads. Hirose's
[EDC-325165-00-00 drawing, page 1, note 2](https://www.hirose.com/product/download/?distributor=chip1&lang=en&num=DM3AT-SF-PEJM5&type=2d)
shows A/B open without a card and closed with a card. The mapping is an
audit of the imported pad identities: B is the rear contact beside DAT1
(MP2), and A is the side contact 10.5 mm forward (MP4). `MP` here is the
imported identifier, not a declaration that every such pad is a shield.
Pin 2 is displayed as `DAT3` to avoid confusing the card's DAT3/CD function
with this independent mechanical switch. No pin numbers were changed.
All fourteen pins remain passive, with consistent 150 mil pin lengths and
50 mil text. The two detect contacts and four shields are visually grouped.
The native Symbol Checker reported no issues at the library checkpoint.
The socket is now J2 on the microSD sheet, with mechanical detect under
CMS-012 and power/data integration under the
[microSD implementation contract](microsd_power_interface.md). Native
placement and BOM reconciliation do not qualify the retained footprint.
microSD has no mechanical write-protect switch. SD1WP is available at P700,
which is already assigned to the radio; it is not needed for this socket.

Sourcing snapshot, 2026-09-08: the exact active socket is
[DigiKey HR1964CT-ND](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/hirose-electric-co-ltd/DM3AT-SF-PEJM5/2533566),
30,851 in stock, USD 3.55 / 3.019 / 2.56560 each at quantities 1 / 10 / 100,
with a quoted 16-week manufacturer lead time. Stock is not reserved and
prices exclude tax/shipping. The imported Mouser part number
`798-DM3AT-SF-PEJM5` is retained; a current US/USD Mouser quote was not
verified in that checkpoint. The dated procurement fields are now in the
schematic instance and reconciled native BOM; retain their observation date.

Use 3.3 V signaling. Do not claim UHS/HS200/HS400 capability from an eMMC
marketing version. The RA8P1 SDHI SDR timing table gives a 20 ns minimum
clock period in the relevant 3.3 V conditions. Keep all CMD/DAT/CLK pins in
the selected _B timing group. Begin initialization at the card-specified
low speed; 50 MHz is an upper interface target, not an automatically valid
board clock. Select CMD/DAT pullups, card-detect pullup, source termination,
low-capacitance protection, effective bypass capacitance and any load switch
after their leakage, drive, timing and inrush calculations. Do not pull up
CLK by habit. Power-off states must not phantom-power the card through IOs.

Confirmed software-definition defect, not changed by this hardware task;
tracked separately in [issue #845](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/845):
[connectors.h](../../libs/ra8_board_ek_ra8d2/inc/ra8_board_ek_ra8d2_connectors.h)
calls P400 CMD, P401 CLK, P406 WP, P407 CD, and selects
instance 0. Both silicon datasheets instead give the assignment above;
P407 has no SD1CD function. The corresponding pin-init routine and demos
must be corrected and tested in a separate firmware change. Copying that
enum into a schematic would create a real wiring error.

The historically validated EK SPI fallback uses SCI0 SCK=P601, COPI=P603,
CIPO=P602, CS=P604 on EK Pmod2. Those pins now serve the placed radio on
this design under CMS-016. The EK example remains a protocol/filesystem
reference, not a compatible replacement for this board's native SDHI1_B.
No switched dual-routing network is proposed for production.

## CMS-004: External RAM and soldered NOR baseline

Both EK boards contain 512 Mbit, 16M x 32 SDRAM, **IS42S32160F-6BLI**.
That is 64 MiB, not 512 MB. EK-RA8P1 uses **MX25LW51245GXDI00** for its
512 Mbit Octal NOR; EK-RA8D2 instead uses **IS25LX512M-JHLE**. Their
capacity is the same but commands, reset behavior and Octal byte ordering
are not interchangeable. See the EK-RA8P1 manual sections 6.3/6.4 and the
[committed EK-RA8D2 manual](../../docs/reference/ek-ra8d2-v1-users-manual.pdf).

The existing imported **IME5132SDBETG-6I** also provides 16M x 32 SDRAM at
3.0..3.6 V, but uses TSOP-86 rather than the EK part's BGA-90. Retaining it
preserves the user's imported part and the required capacity, subject to
pin-by-pin and timing qualification using its actual manufacturer's
[512 Mbit SDRAM datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1445/DS_SDRAM_512Mb_16Mx32_IME5132SDBET_B-3600416.pdf).
Do not infer pin equivalence from matching density or run 166 MHz merely
because the memory is rated for it. RA8P1 SDRAMC timing, selected clock,
trace skew, loading, refresh, voltage and temperature are independent limits.
CMS-010 records the current ISSI selection, exact pin-number contract and
remaining electrical qualification gates; CMS-008 retains historical sourcing.

Reserve these SDRAM signal ports, in bit order:

| Signal group | MCU ports |
| --- | --- |
| A0..A12 | PA03 PA02 PA01 PA00 P503 P504 P505 P506 P507 P508 P509 P510 P608 |
| BA0 / BA1 | PD00 / PC15 |
| DQ0..DQ7 | P302 P301 P300 P112 P113 P114 P115 P609 |
| DQ8..DQ15 | PA11 PA12 PA13 PA14 P610 P611 P612 P613 |
| DQ16..DQ23 | PC14 PC13 PC12 PC11 PC10 PC09 PC08 PC07 |
| DQ24..DQ31 | PC06 PC05 PC04 PC03 PC02 PC01 PC00 P607 |
| CKE / CLK | PA06 / PA15 |
| DQM0..DQM3 | P614 PA05 P615 PA04 |
| WE# / CAS# / RAS# / CS# | PA08 / PA09 / PA10 / P813 |

This consumes 57 distinct signal ports. It conflicts with OSPI1 and with
SSI0_B on P112..P115. Use OSPI0 for NOR and reserve SSI1_B
P702/P701/P700 for audio under CMS-016. P708 is not in this SDRAM allocation.

The selected NOR is now Infineon S28HL01GTFPBHI030, 1 Gbit / 128 MiB,
3 V Octal DDR with a read data strobe. This doubles the EK capacity without
substituting a Quad device. Reserve OSPI0 as follows: CS#=P104/M6,
CLK=P808/U5, DQS=P801/P6; IO0..IO7=P100/U6, P803/P7, P103/R4,
P101/R5, P102/P5, P800/T6, P802/R6, P804/R7. P104 is OM_0_CS1,
not CS0. INT# uses P105/N7 as GPIO IRQ0, not an assumed ECS# protocol.
Flash RESET# joins the existing MCU_RESET_N wire; P106/N6 is released
from the NOR reservation. Internal MCU watchdog/software resets do not
assert that external wire. CMS-011 below is the controlling pin, passive,
reset, sourcing and qualification contract, including ten 30R series paths.

Existing imported IS25LP01GJ-RHLE is 1 Gbit / 128 MiB Quad NOR, not Octal.
The historical capacity-only comparison Winbond **W25Q512JVFIQ**, 64 MiB
Quad NOR, is not an approved fallback for the selected Octal interface.
Its primary [selection guide](https://www.winbond.com/export/sites/winbond/product-selection-guide/file/2025-Product-Selection-Guide-Winbond-Code-Storage-Flash-Memory.pdf)
confirms 2.7..3.6 V and 133 MHz STR, not Octal/DTR equivalence. The
[manufacturer datasheet, section 3.4](https://www.winbond.com/resource-files/W25Q512JV%20SPI%20RevB%2006252019%20KMS.pdf)
gives SOIC-16 pins: IO3=1, VCC=2, RESET#=3, CS#=7, IO1=8, IO2=9,
GND=10, IO0=15, CLK=16; 4..6 and 11..14 are NC/DNU. This older linked
revision is adequate for candidate identification, not final release:
the manufacturer index lists a newer 2026-05-25 revision requiring review.
It must not be silently substituted in the schematic or firmware.

## CMS-005: Optional eMMC and pin-conflict checks

RA8P1 hardware does support eMMC 4.51 through SDHI, including 1/4/8-bit SDR;
this is explicitly in the [RA8P1 hardware manual](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mah/ra8p1-group-users-manual-hardware)
and [Renesas SDHI driver documentation](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___s_d_h_i.html).
Support is not limited to removable SD. Nevertheless, a modern eMMC's
maximum HS200/HS400 rate is not achievable just because its protocol can
fall back to this controller.

For a separate managed-storage option reserve SDHI0_C in four-bit mode:
CLK PD05/C16, CMD PD04/C14, DAT0 PD03/C15, DAT1 PD02/B17,
DAT2 PD01/B16, DAT3 P111/E8. No overlap with the preceding mandatory buses.
The EK SCI8 console already uses PD02/PD03; move that console if this option
is implemented. The eight-bit extension consumes DAT4 P110, DAT5 P109,
DAT6 P108, DAT7 P206, with DAT7 conflicting with CMS-016 CEU VIO_D0.
No eMMC MPN, supply network or connector is approved by this reservation.

The original EK DVP camera group uses P703/P702/P701/P700/P406/P405/P902/P400
for eight data bits, plus PB02/PB03/PB04 for synchronization/clock. It
therefore directly conflicts with SSI1_B audio and native microSD.
CMS-016 uses an alternate CEU8 mapping and relocates the radio to SCI0.
These are pin conflicts, not problems solved by software scheduling if the
two external devices remain physically connected without isolation.

## CMS-006: Python-verifiable allocation and capacity arithmetic

Historical single-camera allocation, superseded by CMS-016 for current
pin ownership. The old radio, SSI1_A and volume-up groups below are retained
only to reproduce the original conflict analysis; do not implement them.
Executed using Python's standard library. This proves the listed historical
sets and arithmetic, not alternate-function programming or timing closure.

```python
from itertools import combinations

groups = {

```

Results: 67,108,864 bytes; VGA frame 614,400 bytes; full-resolution YUV422
frame 10,077,696 bytes; PCM 1,152,000 bytes/s; only 58.254222 seconds if
the historical minimum 64 MiB NOR capacity were used for that PCM; the
selected 128 MiB NOR is checked separately in CMS-011. The native SD bus
theoretical payload is 25,000,000 bytes/s before protocol overhead and media stalls.
Two large frames fitting RAM does not prove capture frame rate, CPU/cache
coherency, DMA arbitration, ISP throughput or available application heap.
Audio buffering must cover real card latency, not this raw bus-rate quotient.

For IME RAM, Mouser part 822-IME5132SDBETG-6I also exists; the observed
139-stock category result was older cached data, not a verified current US
snapshot. Refresh through the user's distributor browser before BOM release.
CU450 availability and the final camera connector/cable remain open.

Before marking the native sections complete: resolve those source gates;
verify every selected memory's symbol pins and supply domains; add local
bypass, startup/reset and pull networks with calculation IDs; check rail
inrush and hard-off behavior; reconcile this allocation against every other
sheet; perform schematic visual review and ERC. The GPIO set test excludes
unallocated power-control outputs, touch, e-paper, frontlight and additional
audio control nets, so it is not a full-project conflict signoff.

Suggested schematic note: `CMS-001..010: design/camera_storage_interfaces.md`.
Place the relevant local calculation/result beside each functional block,
not a large unrelated wall of text on the root sheet.

## CMS-008: Stocked single-device SDRAM alternative

Recommend **Alliance AS4C16M32SC-7TIN** as the sourced schematic candidate,
not as a pin-compatible replacement for the EK's BGA90 device. It preserves
64 MiB, x32, four-bank, 13-row/9-column organization. CMS-010 contains the
completed 86-pin identity audit; this record does not change the native BOM.
The existing IME part's two-unit DigiKey stock is not a robust sourcing basis.

Use the SC datasheet's **7.5 ns minimum CL3 period / 133 MHz** rating, not
the 143 MHz family-catalog entry. Its VDD/VDDQ are 3.0..3.6 V LVTTL;
industrial ambient rating is -40..85 C. Input limits are VIH >=2.0 V and
VIL <=0.8 V; output guarantees are VOH >=2.4 V and VOL <=0.4 V at 4 mA.
Full-temperature self-refresh IDD6 is <=5 mA; x32 operating/burst/refresh
maxima are 70/90/170 mA under their distinct datasheet test conditions.
Those currents are not additive modes. Capacitive I/O switching adds load.
[Alliance SC primary datasheet, Rev.1.0, Tables 1/2/10/12/13](https://www.alliancememory.com/wp-content/uploads/AllianceMemory_512M-SDRAM_Cdie_AS4C16M32SC-AS4C32M16SC-AS4C64M8SC-7TIN_Sept2018_rev1.0.pdf).

The SB alternative is 90-ball, 8 x 13 mm BGA, 3.0..3.6 V, CL3/166 MHz;
the actually stocked BCN grade is only 0..70 C. Its Table 15 specifies
**60 mA maximum self-refresh**, visually verified as mA rather than uA.
Its larger inventory therefore does not justify selecting it for retention
sleep. At nominal 3.3 V, the RAM-only worst-case retention allocations are
16.5 mW for SC versus 198 mW for SB, a factor of 12. At 3.6 V they become
18 mW and 216 mW. Neither is an ultra-low-power retained-memory promise.
[Alliance SB primary datasheet, Rev.1.0, February 2023](https://www.alliancememory.com/wp-content/uploads/AllianceMemory_512Mb_AS4C16M32SB-6BxN_Datasheet_16Feb2023_ver1.0.pdf).

The existing [SDRAM HAL timing definitions](../../libs/ra8_hal/src/ra8_sdramc.c)
document 125 MHz, CL3, RAS=6, RCD=4, RP=4, WR=2 cycles,
refresh recovery=12 cycles and refresh interval=900 cycles. The following
checks those documented nominal durations against SC minimums. It does
not independently decode MCU registers or prove read/write setup, hold,
clock skew, signal integrity, mode-register recovery or self-refresh exit.

```python
from math import isclose

sdclk_hz = 125_000_000
tck_ns = 1e9 / sdclk_hz
cycles = {"tRAS": 6, "tRCD": 4, "tRP": 4, "tWR": 2, "tRFC": 12}
sc_min_ns = {"tRAS": 44, "tRCD": 15, "tRP": 15, "tWR": 15, "tRFC": 66}
assert tck_ns >= 7.5
for name, count in cycles.items():
    actual_ns = count * tck_ns
    assert actual_ns >= sc_min_ns[name], name
    print(name, "nominal ns", actual_ns, "margin ns", actual_ns - sc_min_ns[name])
assert (cycles["tRAS"] + cycles["tRP"]) * tck_ns >= 66  # same-bank tRC
refresh_us = 900 / sdclk_hz * 1e6
assert refresh_us <= 7.8  # datasheet conservative rounded interval
assert 8192 * 900 / sdclk_hz <= 64e-3
assert 16 * 2**20 * 32 // 8 == 64 * 2**20
for volts in (3.3, 3.6):
    print("retention mW at V", volts, "SC", volts * 5, "SB", volts * 60)
assert isclose(60 / 5, 12)
print("refresh us", refresh_us, "8192-row sweep ms", 8192 * 900 / sdclk_hz * 1e3)
```

Executed results: nominal durations RAS/RCD/RP/WR/RFC = 48/32/32/16/96 ns;
margins = 4/17/17/1/30 ns. Refresh interval = 7.2 us and full sweep =
58.9824 ms. The 1 ns write-recovery margin deserves explicit clock and
controller-encoding review; nominal arithmetic is not production signoff.
Keep VDD and VDDQ in the same sequenced 3.3 V domain and audit every supply
pin and bypass location. Do not power-gate RAM while MCU outputs remain
driven. Hard-off loses RAM; retained sleep requires correct self-refresh
entry/exit and an always-retained supply. Capacity equivalence does not
establish evaluation-board timing or firmware equivalence.

The retrieved SC document still labels its revision preliminary; confirm
the contractual current specification with Alliance for production release.
For this schematic phase, it is the best verified stocked industrial
single-x32 candidate found, not a claim of abundant long-term supply.

## CMS-009: Five exposed controls and wake allocation

This implements the allocation basis for the owner's five-button requirement
in [ereader_requirements.md](ereader_requirements.md), issues #821/#832.
Native checkpoint, 2026-09-07: page 8,
[user_controls.kicad_sch](../ereader/user_controls.kicad_sch), now contains
the four placed and locally wired page/volume circuits: 20 purchased parts,
12 GND symbols, four +3V3_MCU pullup connections and four output hierarchical
labels. The native XML export independently confirms the local connectivity.
Both visible CMS-009 calculation notes are now drawn and link back to this
record. Matching MCU-leaf Input labels/wires and all four root routes are
complete. Independent KiCad 10.0.5 XML export verifies each filtered node
through the hierarchy to exactly its assigned P309/A12, P310/E10, P311/B12
or P909/B14 pin. All eight native sheets are accessible and every root
sheet's port names/directions match its child labels. This closes the
four-key schematic-connectivity checkpoint, not firmware wake validation
or hardware qualification.

The full-project ERC run on 2026-09-07 at 21:22 local time reports 204
errors and two warnings, with zero findings on page 8 or the six assigned
MCU control pins. The whole project is not ERC-clean: 197 unconnected-pin
errors, four undriven-power errors, three VLO output-conflict errors and
two radio-label warnings remain. The run included error, warning and
exclusion severities; ignored project checks were not silently re-enabled.
The native GUI review additionally displays 15 excluded warnings: 17
warnings including exclusions and 221 total displayed findings. Those
excluded findings are not counted as fixed by the four-key work.
These findings must remain visible while the remaining sections are built.

Reciprocal native note identifiers are:

- `CMS-009 - FOUR INDEPENDENT PAGE / VOLUME KEYS`, UUID
  `0a046f20-7e8a-4e51-abb0-1f079de7b531`: references, DC corner assumptions,
  threshold/contact equations and held-key current.
- `CMS-009 - FILTER TIMING AND BUTTON BEHAVIOR`, UUID
  `6bf7c991-6015-499e-997f-02b0f6403ffd`: conditional capacitance range,
  nominal RC equations, debounce, boot/held-key behavior and ESD limits.

| Key / output net | Switch | Series, 1k | Pullup, 10k | Filter, 100n | TVS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PAGE_PREV_N | SW2 | R23 | R27 | C58 | D2 |
| PAGE_NEXT_N | SW3 | R24 | R28 | C59 | D3 |
| VOL_DOWN_N | SW4 | R25 | R29 | C60 | D4 |
| VOL_UP_N | SW5 | R26 | R30 | C61 | D5 |

These are the native references for every calculation in CMS-009 below.
SW2..SW5 pin 2, D2..D5 pin 1 and R23..R26 pin 1 form each protected
external node. R23..R26 pin 2, R27..R30 pin 2, C58..C61 pin 1 and the
corresponding assigned U1 pin form each filtered output node. Pullup pin 1
goes to +3V3_MCU; switch pin 1,
capacitor pin 2 and TVS pin 2 go to GND. No external or filtered node is
shared between keys. This pin-number mapping is from KiCad's XML netlist,
not an assumption based on the rotated resistor's appearance.

The four matching root routes and exact end-to-end netlist checks pass.
The full PDF and BOM have been refreshed, with native visual review of all
eight PDF pages. Preserve the verified routes and keep these exports
synchronized during subsequent work.
U1's P309_IN/P310_IN/P311_IN
and P307_IN selected pin functions model the intended Input types;
the reusable default GPIO types are Bidirectional. Symbol functions do not
configure the MCU's firmware pin routing or prove wake behavior.

Evidence: RA8P1 datasheet Table 1.17 and
[Hardware Manual R01UH1064EJ0130](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mah/ra8p1-group-users-manual-hardware),
Tables 21.2/21.10/21.16, pp.849/869/877. All five use the VCC domain,
here switched +3V3_MCU. The four direct-key inputs are non-5V-tolerant;
P303 is 5V-tolerant, but its pullup still belongs to +3V3_MCU. Datasheet
Tables 2.5/2.7 give Schmitt limits 0.8*VCC high and 0.2*VCC low, with
1 uA off-state leakage for the direct-key pins and 5 uA for P303.

P312 was rejected despite its C13 entry in Table 1.17: HUM Table 21.10
visually marks it unavailable for MIPI289. The original P909 allocation
avoided that unresolved conflict; CMS-016 now moves volume-up to P307
and reserves P909 for CEU. CMS-016 records the current IRQ27 flag/edge
registers and qualification limits. Do not confuse the e-reader with EK header
routing. The older GPIO test in CMS-006 records the original reservations. IRQ channels
also remain distinct from camera IRQ14 and radio IRQ19/26. Alternate IRQ
functions on SDRAM, debug and other peripheral pins must remain disabled.

The four placed direct-key circuits share this topology:

```text
+3V3_MCU -- 10k --+-- PAGE_PREV_N (or other allocated MCU input)

The placed parts use EVQP7A01P switches, RC0603FR-0710KL pullups,
RC0603FR-071KL series resistors and C1608X7R1H104K080AA capacitors from
[BTN-003/006](single_button_power.md). Disable MCU internal pulls; their
10..300 uA spread is not the resistor calculation. The external defaults
also exist during reset. No key is a boot strap, resistor ladder or matrix;
all four can be pressed simultaneously without ghosting or output contention.
The power switch retains its independent LTC2954 PB circuit and internal
reset/boot service pads remain separate. Do not wire that switch directly
to P303 or tie any of these keys to MD, radio BOOT, EN or KILL.
The separate shutdown output POWER_KILL_N uses P903/D9;
[BTN-009](single_button_power.md#btn-009-actual-ra8p1-interrupt-and-shutdown-pins)
contains the open-drain initialization and 70 mV guaranteed DC low-margin check.

D2..D5 place one **ESD441DPYR** at each direct key's external node, before
its 1k resistor. Its ground-only protection has no supply-rail connection that
could bypass hard-off. TI SLVSH26C, verified 2026-09-12, corrects the
recommended IO-to-GND range to 0..5.5 V; the earlier negative steady-state
rating is not supported. Section 5.6 specifies 5.5 V positive stand-off
with <100 nA across operating temperature. The separate 50 nA maximum
leakage row applies at 5.5 V and 25 C, not all temperatures. The pin map
is 1=IO, 2=GND. The positive 3.0..3.6 V key calculation and its 0.1 uA
TVS allocation below remain valid; no negative DC rating is needed.

Executed, with outward-rounded bounds: closed <0.341555 V; correlated
minimum low margin >0.31503 V; filtered input VHIGH >2.97755 V;
contact >265.14 uA; four held <1.345 mA. The exact screened input-high
value is 2.9775578 V and contact current is 265.141555... uA; do not round
these lower bounds upward inside a >= claim. The exposed open-contact
voltage is a different node: allowing the TVS's 0.1 uA through the maximum
series resistance gives 2.97745579 V, hence >2.97745 V and above 2 V.
Nominal RC threshold delays are 0.193 ms assertion / 1.514 ms release.
These are noise filtering, not complete debounce: require 20 ms continuously
stable state per key before delivering a press/release. The switch specifies
10 ms bounce. RC timing is nominal; debounce must not depend on a precise
X7R capacitance. Opposing page or volume keys cancel their corresponding
action until one is released; firmware limits volume to the qualified audio
range. Reset/update may ignore ordinary actions until all keys release.

**Wake contract:** retained-rail Sleep uses each routed IRQ; Software Standby
also needs WUPEN configuration. Hardware disables the ordinary PCLKB IRQ
filter in Software Standby (HUM 14.5.6), so retain the external RC and debounce
after wake. Deep Sleep uses the allocated IELSR/NVIC slot's DSLPWUPIRQEN
bit, not blindly the external IRQ number. Deep Software Standby is a reset
wake: preserve/capture the wake cause and reconstruct state. For all five
keys, enable DPSIER4 bits 5/7 and DPSIER5 bits 0/1/5; select falling edges
by clearing the corresponding DPSIEGR3/4 bits. Preserve unrelated sources.
After modifying enables, observe the manual's six-PCLKB-cycle wait and
read-before-zero flag clearing (11.2.33/34). Recheck inputs and pending
events when entering sleep; do not enter edge-wake standby with a key already
held. Read, debounce and wait for release after reset so one held key does
not create repeated actions. These are firmware requirements, not changes
to the current firmware or proof that SDRAM is retained in every mode.

In hard-off, the four direct keys do nothing: no live pullups or energy source
remain in their circuit. Only the power controller starts the rails. In a
firmware freeze, page/volume cannot recover the system; the held power key
still forces off independently. POWER_BUTTON_N's existing 10k pullup to
the switched rail accepts LTC2954 INT <=0.4 V at 3 mA with >=0.2 V low
margin at VCC=3.0 V; a conservative sink requirement is <0.374 mA. Its
high-state allowance of 5 uA P303 +2 uA INT +1 uA board gives >=2.918392 V.
The 2 uA INT allowance exceeds the published 1 uA test at 3 V; it is not
a new manufacturer guarantee at every voltage. Keep P303 input-only and
use the controller's debounce, not the four direct-key RC for the PB timer.
The visible schematic math notes use calculation ID `CMS-009` and link to
`../design/camera_storage_interfaces.md`. Their SW2..SW5, R23..R26,
R27..R30, C58..C61 and D2..D5 references match the reciprocal table above.
The notes show the voltage/leakage/tolerance assumptions, threshold/contact
equations and nominal RC calculations, not only component values. Keep
these two notes and this record synchronized when values or assumptions
change; their presence is not hardware qualification.

## CMS-010: IS42S32160F-7TLI pin and electrical contract

Native SDRAM interconnect and reset-default checkpoint, 2026-09-08, for
[memory issue #827](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/827).
This section records native SDRAM implementation and its electrical
contract, not electrical qualification or fabrication approval. It does not
change firmware, ERC settings or the existing CMS-009 controls checkpoint.
The selected part is ISSI
IS42S32160F-7TLI; this supersedes the CMS-008 historical Alliance candidate
for implementation without rewriting that sourcing history. Footprint geometry
is outside this pin-number audit. Page 10 contains the placed memory units,
completed power/bypass wiring and all 57 signal connections through the
root hierarchy to page 2. The ten command/clock pullups and all 57 selected
MCU electrical pin roles are now implemented. Startup, signal-integrity,
timing, power-distribution and shutdown qualification remain open.

### CMS-010A: Complete pin-number map

The 57 signal rows below match CMS-004 and the current project MCU library
pin identities. The memory A0 pin receives MCU external-bus A02, not A00.
MCU A02..A14 connect to memory A0..A12; MCU A15/A16 connect to BA0/BA1.
For x32, select the nine-bit row-address shift, `SDADR.MXC=01`, and 32-bit
bus width. Memory A10/AP receives MCU A12's precharge-select function.
There are 13 row bits, nine column bits, four banks, and four bytes/word:
`8192 * 512 * 4 * 4 = 67108864 bytes = 64 MiB`.

| Supply or unused group | ISSI pins | Connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VDD | 1, 15, 29, 43 | +3V3_MCU |
| VDDQ | 3, 9, 35, 41, 49, 55, 75, 81 | Same +3V3_MCU |
| VSS | 44, 58, 72, 86 | GND |

All 86 numbers were checked against ISSI Rev. C p3 and compared with the
existing `Memory:IME5132SDBETG-6I` symbol:
57 signal, 12 power, 12 ground and five NC identities match. A distinct
ISSI symbol `Memory:IS42S32160F-7TLI` now reuses that four-unit drawing
through native Save As, with separate sourced identity, datasheet and BOM
fields and no inherited IME on-die-ECC claim. The native symbol has 25
control/address Input pins, 32 Bidirectional DQ pins, 24 Power input
supply/ground pins and five Not connected pins. Native Symbol Checker
reported no issues. All four U14 units are now placed. The 12 supply pins
connect to +3V3_MCU, the 12 ground pins connect to GND, and the five NC
pins remain isolated. Those power/bypass and NC connections are unchanged
from the preceding checkpoint. Native XML now verifies all 56 direct U1-U14
signal pairs against the table above. CLK is the remaining signal:
U1.E1 and R43.2 form `SDRAM_CLK_SRC`; R43.1 and U14.68 form `SDRAM_CLK`.
The populated 0R link preserves separate source and load nets.

Each leaf now has four vector hierarchical labels,
`SDRAM_A[0..12]`, `SDRAM_BA[0..1]`, `SDRAM_DQ[0..31]` and
`SDRAM_DQM[0..3]`, plus six scalar labels: `SDRAM_CLK`, `SDRAM_CKE`,
`SDRAM_CS_N`, `SDRAM_RAS_N`, `SDRAM_CAS_N` and `SDRAM_WE_N`.
All ten root sheet-pin connections join the matching leaf labels; the
whole-project XML contains 284 nets. No memory signal is marked no-connect.

The checkpoint CLI ERC reports 145 errors and two active warnings, with
zero findings on page 10 and no SDRAM-related root findings. All 147 active
finding identities are unchanged by the MCU pin-role and pullup work.
The native GUI shows 145 errors and 17 warnings, including the same 15 existing excluded
warnings; all four ignored checks are unchanged. No new exclusion or rule
waiver was used to obtain these counts. The project is not ERC-clean.
The native BOM contains 63 groups, 173 components and 18 columns, including
R43 and one quantity-ten row for R44-R53. Reciprocal CMS-010 notes are
present on pages 2 and 10.

All 57 selected MCU signal pins now have the intended electrical types:
25 Output address/control/clock pins and 32 Bidirectional DQ pins. The
project symbol and all four embedded MCU definitions are updated.
Symbol pin typing is an ERC model, not firmware pin configuration or
dynamic driver qualification. R44-R53 implement the ten 10k command/clock
pullups specified below. This checkpoint does not establish full-circuit
ERC acceptance or electrical qualification.

### CMS-010B: Shared supply, pull and bypass basis

Use the same switched +3V3_MCU for VDD, VDDQ and their pullups. Both MCU VCC
and VCC2 must remain in the 3.3 V domain: DQ0..19 use VCC and DQ20..31 use
VCC2. The 3.0..3.6 V memory range is narrower than the MCU's general
operating range. No separately powered probe or peripheral may inject this
bus during hard-off. The PWR-003 250 mA memory allocation remains a design
limit to qualify, not a proven worst-case consumption bound: ISSI's -7 IDD4
maximum is 210 mA with outputs open, before external I/O charging current.
Do not scale that table limit linearly with clock rate or omit bus loading.
Include all added capacitors in SYS-007's main-rail
discharge-capacitance budget. [Main digital power basis](power_decoupling.md).

The placed default network is ten separate 10k pullups on CKE, DQM0..3,
CS#, RAS#, CAS#, WE# and CLK. Every resistor pin 1 connects to switched
+3V3_MCU; its pin 2 connects to the signal in this native reference map:

| Reference | Signal net | U14 pin |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| R44 | SDRAM_CKE | 67 |
| R45 | SDRAM_DQM0 | 16 |
| R46 | SDRAM_DQM1 | 71 |
| R47 | SDRAM_DQM2 | 28 |
| R48 | SDRAM_DQM3 | 59 |
| R49 | SDRAM_CS_N | 20 |
| R50 | SDRAM_RAS_N | 19 |
| R51 | SDRAM_CAS_N | 18 |
| R52 | SDRAM_WE_N | 17 |
| R53 | SDRAM_CLK | 68 |

R53 is on R43's memory side, not `SDRAM_CLK_SRC`. The five CKE/DQM pulls
preserve the required high states while MCU pins are inputs; CS# high
inhibits commands. The
other control pulls avoid floating command inputs, and CLK high matches
the peripheral's disabled-clock polarity. Do not substitute a CKE pull-down
or rely on firmware-enabled internal pullups during reset. These pulls do
not supply the missing power-on clock or prove initialization by themselves.

All ten parts are YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL, DigiKey 311-10.0KHRCT-ND,
with native value `10k` and footprint geometry deferred. The verified
2026-09-08 [DigiKey sourcing snapshot](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/yageo/RC0603FR-0710KL/729827)
is 2,866,522 in stock, USD 0.10 / 0.025 / 0.0122 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100;
availability is not reserved. The part is 0603, +/-1%, +/-100 ppm/C,
0.1 W at 70 C, with a -55..155 C operating range and 75 V maximum working
voltage; the power/temperature derating requirement still applies.
Screen +/-1% initial tolerance and +/-100 ppm/C over a conservative 100 C
change, as in BTN-006:
`Rmin = 10000 * 0.99 * 0.99 = 9801 Ohm` and
`Rmax = 10000 * 1.01 * 1.01 = 10201 Ohm`.
ISSI input leakage is +/-5 uA; the selected non-5V-tolerant MCU ports
have +/-1 uA off-state leakage. Add 1 uA board leakage as a qualification
allocation, not a vendor guarantee. For a tristated MCU input,
`Ioff = (5 + 1 + 1) uA = 7 uA`, hence
`VHIGHmin = 3.0 - 7e-6 * 10201 = 2.928593 V`.
For an actively LOW MCU output, its input-leakage term is not added again:
`Isink = 3.6 / 9801 + (5 + 1)e-6 = 0.373309458... mA`, below the
ordinary control pins' 1 mA DC test condition. The CLK pullup is selected
for the MCU's reset/disabled-clock polarity, not a pull-down leakage failure.
The CLK output itself is PA15's high-speed drive class and needs the
separate waveform qualification below, not the generic control-pin VOL proof.
[Yageo RC0603FR-0710KL specification](https://www.yageogroup.com/component-documentation/download/specsheet/RC0603FR-0710KL).

The conservative resistor stress uses the full 3.6 V across Rmin, without
credit for a nonzero GPIO low voltage:
`Pmax = 3.6^2 / 9801 = 1.322314049... mW` per resistor.
For all ten signals LOW at once, the pull-resistor rail load is
`10 * 3.6 / 9801 = 3.673094582... mA`, and their total heat is
`10 * 3.6^2 / 9801 = 13.223140495... mW`.
Including the memory/board leakage terms in the conservative sink sum gives
`10 * Isink = 3.733094582... mA`. These are static screens, not estimates
of normal command duty cycle or memory switching current. Reserve 4 mA
inside the existing PWR-003 250 mA SDRAM allocation, leaving 246 mA for
the memory and dynamic I/O qualification; do not increase the main
1.65 A allocation silently. The remaining 246 mA is an allocation, not a
verified worst-case bound. All screens require the stated leakage,
temperature and resistor bounds; they do not establish lifetime drift,
signal integrity or board thermal qualification.

These ten pullups introduce no always-on source or intentional capacitance:
their rail is the same switched +3V3_MCU as MCU VCC/VCC2 and memory
VDD/VDDQ. Do not count them as guaranteed shutdown discharge paths when
MCU pins tristate, or permit an externally powered probe to inject the bus
during hard-off. Retained self-refresh must actively hold CKE LOW against
R44, adding up to `3.6 / 9801 = 0.367309458... mA` resistor current.
Releasing that drive lets the pullup change the intended retention state.
Hard-off still discards RAM; startup, retention and shutdown qualification
remain separate from the completed passive interconnections.

Page 10's completed bypass wiring is C76-C87, 12 x 100nF, one for each
VDD/VDDQ pin, plus C88, 10uF local bulk, with no separate filter or load
switch splitting VDDQ. The parts are C1608X7R1H104K080AA and
C3216X7R1V106K160AC. Their nominal total is 11.2uF, within the main-rail
capacitance budget; effective capacitance and power-distribution impedance
are not qualified by the nominal sum or schematic wiring.
These are engineering starting values, not an ISSI capacitance minimum
or proof of effective capacitance, impedance or transient response. Qualify
bias, temperature, aging and mounting inductance with the selected parts.
The [Renesas quick guide](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/ra8p1-mcu-quick-design-guide)
and [memory architecture note](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/getting-started-ra8p1-memory-architecture-configurations-and-topologies)
reviewed here do not prescribe exact SDRAM series-resistor/bypass values.

There is no VREF pin or DDR-style VTT requirement. R43 now provides the
populated source-series clock-resistor position on page 2. Its exact part

R43 is an SI-tuning starting link, not approved damping or timing closure;
no 22/33 Ohm value is approved yet. R53 now pulls up its
memory-side `SDRAM_CLK` node, not `SDRAM_CLK_SRC`.
Decide address/control and bidirectional DQ damping from the actual load,
driver model and both-direction timing. A clock-only delay can consume
write-hold margin. Do not claim the EK resistor value is valid for this
TSOP memory, or copy OSPI trace rules into the SDRAM timing contract.

### CMS-010C: Initialization and retention contract

ISSI Rev. C pp19-20 requires simultaneous VDD/VDDQ rise and at least
100 us with stable CLK, CKE/DQM high and NOP or command-inhibit states,
followed by precharge-all, at least two auto-refresh cycles and MRS.
The note permits MRS before the refresh cycles. A conservative 200 us
and eight refresh cycles may be retained, but waiting with CLK stopped
does not satisfy the stable-clock interval. DQ must not be driven against
the memory during initialization. Program CL2 or CL3; this part does not
support CL1. Do not transfer the Alliance mode-register options blindly.

RA8P1 SDCKOCR resets to zero and disabled SDCLK is high. Firmware must
hold safe command/mask states while starting SDCLK, wait the specified
stable-clock interval, then follow HUM Figure 15.48's 32-bit sequence.
ISSI's startup contract replaces the prior Alliance simultaneous-clock
wording blocker; it does not establish that existing firmware implements it.
In particular,
BSIZE/EXENB sequencing must follow the 32-bit case, rather than using the
16-bit exception. Program mode/timing/address shift, enable refresh and
finally enable accesses with the specified readback/barrier. Existing
`ra8_sdramc_init()` is EK-RA8D2 firmware, not approved ISSI startup:
its reviewed clock enable is immediately followed by initialization with
no explicit clock-stable 100 us pause. No firmware was changed here.

For the -7 grade, the timing-programming basis includes tRC=63 ns,
tRP/tRCD=20 ns, tRRD/tDPL=14 ns, tDAL=35 ns and tXSR=70 ns.
Honor both the 14 ns tMRD entry and p17's two-cycle requirement.
Round each requirement up using the actual controller clock and register
encoding; these values are not already-converted register settings.

Hard-off discards RAM. Retention requires self-refresh entry before stopping
SDCLK, keeping supply present and CKE actively low, including the HUM's
IOKEEP/standby-output handling. Tristating CKE against its pullup exits that
controlled state. Wake must honor the selected part's tXSR, restore the
clock/control sequence and only then permit bus access. Ordinary power-down
is not self-refresh and cannot retain data indefinitely.

### CMS-010D: DC and timing qualification gates

PWR-002's fixed-PWM static main-rail range is
3.242044111..3.358485094 V, not a transient envelope. RA SDRAM inputs require
VIH >=0.7*VCC or 0.7*VCC2, not the generic GPIO 0.8 factor. Against ISSI
VOH >=2.4 V, the static read-high margin is only 49.060435 mV. The rail at
zero high margin is 2.4/0.7 = 3.428571429 V; this is not an acceptable
operating target or allowance to spend on ringing. Establish a positive
noise-margin requirement and measured/modelled IO waveforms, including
rail overshoot and ground offset. Static read-low margin is 572.613233 mV.
ISSI's VOH/VOL limits use -2/+2 mA tests, not the prior Alliance 4 mA test.
Ordinary control-output DC screens give 742.044111 mV high and 300 mV low
margin using the RA 1 mA test, but do not prove dynamic edges or PA15 CLK.

RA Table 2.57 condition 2 requires SDCLK high-speed/high drive, other bus
outputs high drive, and a 15 pF output-load condition. BCLK operation permits
125 MHz; BCLKA has a separate 133 MHz limit. Do not configure simultaneous
CSC operation while claiming these condition-2 timings. ISSI p15 lists
characterized clock capacitance 3.5 pF, command/address 3.8 pF and DQ 6 pF;
MCU input capacitance for these pins is <=8 pF under its listed test.
Interconnect and probes add loading and are not included by those numbers.

The following are zero-interconnect screens at 125 MHz/CL3, not timing
closure. RA delay/setup/hold limits come from Table 2.57. ISSI timings
come from Rev. C pp16-18; no typical parameters are used as
all-corner guarantees.

| Screen | Arithmetic, ns | Unallocated result |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Read setup | 8 - 5.4 - 2.1 | 0.5 ns |
| Write/address/control setup | 8 - 6.0 - 1.5 | 0.5 ns |
| Write/address/control hold | 0.8 - 0.8 | 0 ns |
| Read hold at ISSI's 50 pF test load only | 2.5 - 1.5 | 1.0 ns |

ISSI's -7 tOH=2.5 ns and tAC=5.4 ns use the stated 50 pF test load.
Rev. C gives no 0 pF hold-time endpoint; neither the former Alliance
1.8 ns endpoint nor interpolation supplies an ISSI arbitrary-load guarantee.
The 1 ns read-hold result is therefore a test-load screen, not PCB closure.
ISSI uses a 1.4 V AC timing reference and a 1 ns transition assumption;
RA bus output timing uses the half-supply crossing. Correct the reference
levels and apply ISSI's slow-edge adjustments before adding flight,
skew, jitter, duty-cycle and model uncertainties. Also verify ISSI's
2.5 ns minimum clock-high/low widths and 0.3..1.2 ns transition condition;
RA's separate SDCLK waveform limits are not an automatic compatibility proof.

For matched reference levels, let tc be MCU-to-memory clock flight and td
be data flight. A first write screen adds (td-tc) to hold and subtracts it
from setup; a read setup screen subtracts tc+td. Clock-only series delay
therefore improves write setup but worsens write hold and read setup.
These signs explain why matching lengths or slowing SDCLK alone does not
close every constraint. At 62.5 MHz/CL3 the raw setup screens become 8.5 ns,
but raw write hold remains zero. Use lower frequency for initial evaluation
if appropriate; it is not an approved solution to the hold/DC/startup gates.

## CMS-011: 128 MiB Octal NOR electrical contract

Tracking: [memory issue #827](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/827).
Selected: **Infineon S28HL01GTFPBHI030**, industrial -40..85 C, 1 Gbit,
2.7..3.6 V core and IO, 24-ball 8 x 8 mm BGA, 1 mm pitch, tray.
The [manufacturer product record](https://www.infineon.com/part/S28HL01GTFPBHI030)
identifies an active preferred product. This is an Octal capacity upgrade,
not a pin-compatible or command-compatible substitution for the EK Macronix.
The MCU VCC2 bank remains at +3V3_MCU with SDRAM; a 1.8 V NOR is not a
substitute for this contract.

**Native library checkpoint:** `Memory:S28HL01GTFPBHI030` is implemented in
`../libs/symbols/Memory.kicad_sym`, with 13 interface pins in unit A and
11 power/reserved pins in unit B. All 24 balls are explicit; DNU balls use
the unconnected electrical type. The native Symbol Checker reports no
issues. Both units use 150 mil pins, 50 mil text and filled body outlines.
Exact manufacturer/distributor fields and the dated sourcing snapshot are
embedded in the library symbol; its footprint remains deliberately blank.

**Native supply checkpoint:** page 11,
[`nor_flash.kicad_sch`](../ereader/nor_flash.kicad_sch), now instantiates
U15A/B and C89-C92. Optional unit display names were cleared in the shared
library so references render conventionally as U15A and U15B, without
appending long descriptions. B4/D1/E4 share +3V3_MCU; B3/C1/E5 share GND.
C89-C91 are the selected 100n parts and C92 is the selected 10u part,
all between those same rails, with CMS-011-specific sourcing fields.
All five DNU balls remain explicit, electrically unconnected pins.
No PWR_FLAG or simulation exclusion was added.

**Native series/default-state checkpoint:** R54-R61 connect DQ0-DQ7,
R62 connects CK and R63 connects DS through ten independently sourced
30R parts. Each pin 1 is on its distinct MCU host net; each pin 2
shares a net with exactly its intended U15 ball. R64 is the 10k CS pull
and R65 is the 47k INT pull, both to +3V3_MCU. Their values, manufacturer
parts, order codes, dated availability and qualification notes are native
symbol fields and are included in the whole-project BOM.

**Native MCU/hierarchy checkpoint:** the twelve selected MCU pins now
connect through the root/child hierarchy. Each of the ten host nets contains
exactly its selected U1 ball and series-resistor pin 1, separate from the
corresponding resistor pin 2 / U15 ball net. CS# connects U1.M6, U15.C2 and
R64.2; INT# separately connects U1.N7, U15.A5 and R65.2. RESET# U15.A4 joins
the common node, now J1.10, R1.2, U1.D5, U2.6, U7.3 and U19.6.
The original NOR checkpoint used former U2.1 and preceded U19; RST-002
owns the current supervisor and added microSD gate input. No signal
series resistor is bypassed, and INT# is not joined to common reset.

The project processor library and all four embedded MCU definitions have
the same twelve configured pin-type updates: eight Bidirectional DQ pins,
Output CK/CS# and Input DS/INT#. All 289 ball identities, unit assignments,
positions and other pin properties are preserved. These electrical types
model the selected circuit for ERC; they do not program the MCU.

The integrated whole-project netlist has 299 nets and 193 components.
Its complete node partitions match the prior leaf checkpoint plus the
twelve intended MCU joins and the common-reset join. All 272 partitions
restricted to non-NOR, non-reserved-MCU nodes are unchanged. This is a
connectivity proof, not complete ERC acceptance or electrical qualification.
The final CLI ERC reports 133 active errors and two active warnings; the
native ERC total is 150 including 15 existing excluded warnings. Compared
with the leaf checkpoint, 13 errors and 11 warnings are removed and no
active finding identity is added. The two remaining active warnings are
the existing radio DATA_READY and HANDSHAKE isolated hierarchical labels.
The four ignored checks are unchanged; no new ERC exclusion or rule waiver
was added. The project is not ERC-clean, and rendered-sheet review remains
a separate check.

The refreshed BOM has 69 groups, 18 fields and 190 included references.
The difference from 193 netlist components is exactly the three existing
BOM-excluded service points TP1-TP3. It includes U15 once, four bypass
capacitors and all twelve NOR resistors. Existing CMS-010 and other
component connectivity is preserved.

The native supply annotation `a9ed9069-8e7a-4cab-88ec-2a1ce6c5d680`
on page 11 hyperlinks to CMS-011B, with its arithmetic checked by CMS-011F.
Sheet instance UUID: `23859413-ab36-480e-aeef-d0e8a227b709`.
Reciprocal MCU/interface annotation review remains a separate check.
The native series/pull annotation `18d4ef73-0341-4ce2-81e6-ceda0da87e84`
on page 11 hyperlinks to CMS-011C. Its displayed resistance, leakage and
sink-current arithmetic is recomputed by CMS-011F below. The same native
note records connected MCU hierarchy/common reset, read-only DS with
P801 Input / WRMSKMD=0, and the CMS-011D reset/protocol obligations.

### CMS-011A: Source revision and exact pin contract

The released English manufacturer datasheet available through Mouser is
[002-18216 Rev. AB, 2024-05-13][nor-ab], not advance information. Its
Figure 1 / Table 7, pp.6-7, define the following ball map and directions.
The newer manufacturer [Chinese Rev. AD, 2025-06-30][nor-ad] is a revision
cross-check, not a replacement for controlling English specifications:
its notice gives English precedence. The revision history, p.179, records
AC changes to tDIS, tBE units and thermal data, then AD changes to tSU/tHD.
The current English download redirects to authentication. Obtain and
review current English AD and applicable errata before design release;
no separate public errata found in this review is not proof none exist.

not hide absent wiring; no local PWR_FLAG is justified by this passive load.
Use one common VCC/VCCQ supply node so sequencing cannot make VCCQ exceed
VCC. Do not insert independently switched or delayed VCCQ branches.
The [RA8P1 datasheet Rev.1.30][nor-ra-ds], Table 1.17, confirms the
GPIO/IRQ allocation. The [hardware manual Rev.1.30][nor-ra-hum],
Table 21.2, p.849, identifies the VCC2 supply domain. CMS-006 checks
reservation collisions. P106/N6 is free; no dedicated flash-reset GPIO
is required.

For this flash, DS is read-only output (Rev. AB Table 7, p.7), so the
configured MCU P801 pin is to be an input, not an output. Hardware manual
section 45.2.1.7, p.3003, defines WRMSKMD: leave it at zero so the optional
DQS write-mask output is disabled. Figure 45.10, p.3035, shows the
DDR-with-DS mode sampling DQS while its output enable is low. This is a
required firmware mode contract, not a claim that the firmware is already
implemented; generic pad bidirectionality does not authorize driving the
flash DS output. The native MCU pin-type update is now implemented.

### CMS-011B: Series, default-state and local supply components

[RA8P1 hardware manual Rev.1.30][nor-ra-hum], Table 45.2, p.2997, requires
external **30 ohm +/-1%** series resistors on the eight SIO lines, SCLK and
DQS for the JESD251 driver definition. Thus this circuit requires ten,
not only a clock tuning position. SCLKN is unused. Do not copy SDRAM R43's
0R rule to NOR, and do not add series elements to CS#, RESET# or INT# by
analogy. The proposed MCU-side grouping is a layout starting point; it
does not establish bidirectional signal integrity or prescribe trace lengths.

Select ten **RT0603BRD0730RL**, 30R, +/-0.1%, +/-25 ppm/C. The
[YAGEO RT specification, V17, 2026-02-12][nor-rt] gives 0.1 W at 70 C,
derating to zero at 155 C, and 75 V maximum working voltage for this case.
The actual continuous voltage limit is the lower of 75 V and sqrt(P*R),
not permission to apply 75 V to 30R. These are signal resistors, not
series DC supply resistors. Pulse loading, temperature rise and parasitic
impedance remain SI/qualification tasks.

For a conservative 100 C departure from the resistance reference temperature:

```text
R30min = 30*(1-0.001)*(1-25e-6*100) = 29.895075 ohm
R30max = 30*(1+0.001)*(1+25e-6*100) = 30.105075 ohm
Initial tolerance plus TCR therefore remain inside 29.7..30.3 ohm.
Ordinary +/-1%, 100 ppm/C parts span 29.403..30.603 ohm for the same screen.
```

This does not include aging, assembly drift or AC impedance. Infineon's
factory CFR4N/V[7:5]=101 selects an **internal** nominal 30R driver
(Rev. AB Table 58, p.97); it does not replace the ten external parts.
Keep that initial setting for qualification; any tuning must recheck both
read and write directions and should not rewrite nonvolatile settings
at every boot.

Passive contract; all twelve new resistors and four bypass capacitors are
placed. U15.A4 is connected to the existing common-reset network:

| Function | Quantity / value | Exact MPN | Existing native donor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DQ0..7, CK, DS series | 10 x 30R | YAGEO RT0603BRD0730RL | R54-R63 placed; dedicated 30R metadata |
| CS# idle-high | 1 x 10k to +3V3_MCU | YAGEO RC0603FR-0710KL | R64 placed, sourced from R44 |
| INT# idle-high | 1 x 47k to +3V3_MCU | YAGEO RC0603FR-0747KL | R65 placed; dedicated 47k metadata |
| Local VCC / VCCQ bypass | 3 x 100n to GND | TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA | C89-C91 placed, sourced from C76 |
| Shared local bulk bypass | 1 x 10u to GND | TDK C3216X7R1V106K160AC | C92 placed, sourced from C88 |
| RESET# idle-high | Existing R1, no added pull | Existing common-reset network | No new component |

The capacitor proposal is an engineering starting point, not a claimed
manufacturer minimum or completed impedance design. Nominal total is
`3*0.1 + 10 = 10.3 uF`; initial +/-10% alone gives 9.27..11.33 uF.
[TDK 100n product data][nor-c100] and [10u product data][nor-c10] identify
50 V X7R 0603 and 35 V X7R 1206 respectively. PWR-001 records the 100n
nominal DC-bias curve; the [10u characterization sheet][nor-c10-curve]
is reference characterization, not an all-corners effective-capacitance
guarantee. Include DC bias, temperature, aging, mounting inductance,
rail ripple and main-rail discharge in later PDN qualification.

### CMS-011C: Pull and common-reset arithmetic

Use the PWR-002 static rail envelope 3.242044111..3.358485094 V, with a
separate 3.6 V stress screen; neither includes unqualified transient ripple.
RC0603 initial +/-1% and +/-100 ppm/C over 100 C give multiplicative
resistance bounds 0.9801..1.0201 times nominal. The
[10k manufacturer specification][nor-rc10] and
[47k manufacturer specification][nor-rc47] identify the selected parts.
At the conservative 125 C resistor-temperature screen, linear derating
leaves `0.1*(155-125)/(155-70) = 35.294118 mW`; the DC loads below fit
that power allowance and the lower of sqrt(P*R) or the 75 V case limit.
This does not qualify contamination leakage or reset/interrupt edge speed.

Flash ILI/ILO are +/-2 uA at 85 C (Rev. AB Table 87, pp.131-132,
VCC maximum, input at VIH or VSS, CS# HIGH test conditions).
P105 uses the ordinary **1 uA** MCU input/off-state bound, not an invented
6 uA limit (RA8P1 Table 2.7, p.57). Allocate another 1 uA per node to board
leakage; that is an acceptance condition requiring verification.

```text
R47min/max = 46064.7 / 47944.7 ohm
INT high adverse current = 2uA flash + 1uA MCU + 1uA board = 4uA
INT VHIGHmin = 3.242044111 - 4uA*47944.7 = 3.050265311 V
INT high margin = VHIGHmin - 0.8*3.358485094 = 0.363477236 V
INT low sink = 3.6/46064.7 + 1uA MCU + 1uA board = 80.150949 uA
INT resistor stress = 3.6^2/46064.7 = 0.281343415 mW

R10min/max = 9801 / 10201 ohm
CS high adverse current = 2uA flash + 1uA MCU + 1uA board = 4uA
CS VHIGHmin = 3.242044111 - 4uA*10201 = 3.201240111 V
CS low sink = 3.6/9801 + 2uA flash + 1uA board = 0.370309458 mA
CS resistor stress = 3.6^2/9801 = 1.322314050 mW
```

Infineon recommends a 5k..10k INT pullup, but its tabulated VOL <=0.2 V
test is only 100 uA. The selected 47k is an explicit design departure to
stay within that guaranteed DC test load: do not silently claim it is the
vendor's recommendation. Its release-edge RC time and interrupt detection
need qualification with actual trace/input capacitance and configured IRQ
filtering, including release during active transactions rather than only
the table's CS# HIGH leakage test. There is no arbitrary frequency or
maximum-capacitance guarantee in this calculation. Flash off-state leakage is not added again to the
actively sinking flash output; board/MCU adverse current is.

The current common reset net contains R1.2, U2.6, U1.D5, J1.10,
U7.3, U15.A4 and the added microSD power-gate input U19.6. U2 is now
TPS389001DSET. [RST-002](reset_coordination_tps3890.md) owns the current
source, threshold and loading basis; former TPS3808 U2.1/1mA/3.02395V
calculations are superseded.

The prior 12 uA device allocation was MCU 5 uA + U7 5 uA + flash 2 uA;
it did not reserve U19. Adding its 5 uA gives 17 uA. Preserve the former
13 uA overhead, giving **30 uA total** for devices, released-supervisor
leakage, board, probe and any other adverse current. This is an installed
acceptance allocation, not a measured or universally guaranteed sum.
Using RST-002's main envelope and R1=9801..10201 ohm:

```text
Sink <= 3.393012496/9801 + 30uA = 0.376190439 mA <0.4 mA
Released high >= 3.151819680 - 30uA*10201 = 2.845789680 V
MCU high margin = 2.845789680 - .8*3.151819680 = 0.324333936 V
At falling-corner rail 3.000822727 V: high >=2.694792727 V
MCU high margin at falling corner = 0.294134545 V
U19 additional drop = 5uA*10201 = 51.005 mV
```

U2 VOL <=0.25 V at VDD>=1.5 V and 0.4 mA applies to this conditional
sink screen. Flash's 2 uA term still contributes 20.402 mV, already
inside the total. Its RESET# adds at most 7.5 pF (Table 85, p.130);
MCU/gate capacitance figures do not establish a whole-node maximum.
Keep R1 and qualify receiver thresholds, release edges, probe loading,
startup and brownout; no additional NOR pullup is proposed. The falling
corner is a static screen, not a reset propagation or rail-collapse proof.

### CMS-011D: Power, reset and transaction contract

Apply Rev. AB sections 4.13/4.15, pp.73-81, and Table 89, pp.140-141:
CS# must track the rising supply and remain inactive during initialization.
For 1 Gbit, tPU is 500 us maximum after VCC reaches its operating minimum;
tRP is 200 ns minimum, tRH is 500 us **from RESET# LOW to CS# LOW**,
and tRS is 50 ns from RESET# HIGH to CS# LOW. A long-held reset can
cover tRH; 500 us after every release is not the datasheet definition.

The implementation policy is deliberately conservative: keep CS# HIGH and
wait at least **1 ms after both qualified supply and external reset release**
before the first NOR command. This is a firmware/fixture obligation, not a
newly implemented delay circuit. Current U2's conditional >=8.148276 ms
CT charge interval (RST-002) and the 3 ms service reset cover the long-reset
case under their stated supply conditions; a short debug pulse must still
meet tRP and the pre-access delay. NOR reset timing must not be inferred
from the MCU's shorter minimum reset pulse/internal wait.

Hardware RESET# only handles assertions of the external MCU_RESET_N wire.
An internal MCU watchdog or software reset can leave NOR powered in its
previous volatile Octal state. Initialization must recover the current
protocol without unsafe speculative writes, inspect device status, then
configure the intended mode before XIP or DMA. Use the read-only DS
direction in the selected xSPI flash profile; do not apply
HyperBus write-mask signaling or drive against the flash strobe output.
Preserve the factory nonvolatile SPI startup configuration and enter Octal through volatile
configuration. Hardware reset reloads nonvolatile configuration; it does
not erase a previously changed nonvolatile mode back to factory SPI.
Recovery after internal resets, resets during writes and corrupt settings
requires explicit testing. No firmware changes are included in this record.

The full cold-restart screen requires VCC below 0.7 V for at least 25 us
after a drop below the 2.4 V cutoff; observe the specified minimum rise/fall
times of 1/30 us per volt, not an assumed instantaneous safe ramp.
Include the local 10.3 uF in SYS-007 hard-off/discharge qualification;
the whole-rail capacitance/active-load contract still controls. Neither
shared reset nor supply discharge guarantees completion of interrupted
program/erase. Journaled metadata and recoverable images remain required.

This part is not a promise of the Macronix LW family's true simultaneous
read/write behavior. Use the documented suspend/read/resume restrictions,
or execute update-critical code from internal MRAM/SDRAM. Do not assume
uninterrupted XIP from NOR while an embedded write operation blocks reads.

### CMS-011E: Clock and power qualification gates

The proposed performance baseline is **125 MHz Octal DDR with DS**, not
Quad, and not a production timing guarantee. The selected HL-T limit is
166 MHz: `1e9/166e6 = 6.024096386 ns`. A 166.666667 MHz MCU divider with
a 6 ns period exceeds it despite rounded marketing labels. Frequency
tolerance also belongs in the final selected-clock proof.

The RA8P1 Rev.1.30 Table 2.65 high-speed conditions, drive selections and
15 pF loading must be applied to the actual paths including all ten series
resistors. In particular, minimum specified MCU CK slew and the flash AC
test slew are not interchangeable; a nominal frequency comparison does
not close timing. Verify DS alignment, input/output loading, trace skew,
setup/hold, clock duty cycle, ringing and overshoot at supply/temperature
corners. Current English AD review is also required; retaining AB's more
conservative low-speed SPI setup/hold values is an interim screen, not
permission to disregard a changed released specification.

Rev. AB Table 87, pp.132-134, gives 1 Gbit program/erase maxima of 66 mA,
POR 80 mA, 85 C standby 160 uA and deep-power-down 26 uA. Read-current
figures exclude output switching. Its 173 mA DDR row is labeled 200 MHz
for both HL/HS devices although the selected HL maximum is 166 MHz.
That ambiguity prevents treating 173 mA as a clean manufacturer bound for
this exact selected operating point.

Reserve **250 mA for this NOR domain** as a qualification allocation,
including its IO switching and pulls, not a manufacturer maximum.
For an illustrative 15 pF total load on each of eight data outputs plus DS,
with one charging transition per clock cycle on every output:

```text
I_switch_screen = 9 * 15pF * Vrail_max * fCK
At 125 MHz: 56.674436 mA; 173 + 56.674436 = 229.674436 mA
At 166 MHz: 75.263651 mA; 173 + 75.263651 = 248.263651 mA
```

This is charge arithmetic, not a simulation or a guarantee that 173 mA is
valid/monotonic at lower clocks. The illustrative 15 pF must include the
actual receiving/input and interconnect load; flash input capacitance is
not a replacement for that output-load budget. Do not add the MCU's CK
driver loss to NOR current while omitting it from the MCU rail budget.
Reserve 1 mA within the 250 mA for the two external pulls and leakage;
the executable screen below checks this conservative static allowance.

The earlier PWR-003 NOR allocation of 100 mA is superseded for this
selected part. Keeping other allocations unchanged raises the main rail
from **1.65 A to 1.80 A**, the radio-off cold-start reference screen from
1.730 A to **1.880 A**, and the wake screen from 1.670 A to **1.820 A**.
Radio-on cold start would screen at **2.380 A** and remains prohibited.
These are allocations/reference-current sums, not all-corners startup
maxima; non-DCDC MCU current, capacitor charging, regulator efficiency,
current-limit behavior, thermal rise and load transients still need closure.
At 1.80 A the existing nominal 2 A TPS63802 has only 0.20 A nameplate
headroom; do not certify guaranteed delivery or thermal margin from that
subtraction. Reopen [PWR-003](power_decoupling.md#pwr-003-tps63802-main-digital-converter)
and the battery/source budget before approving simultaneous operation.
High-quality audio, radio and the required storage scope are not silently
reduced to make this arithmetic fit.

Historical NOR-only checkpoint verification follows. Its U2.1 identity,
six-endpoint reset partition, component/net counts and BOM expectations
predate RST-002 and U19; do not run it against current native exports or
use it as the current reset contract. It requires the corresponding saved
checkpoint XML and BOM. The export command records the original procedure:

## CMS-012: Independent mechanical microSD card detect

2026-09-08 implementation contract; native mechanical detect wiring and
host/root hierarchy integration are complete and netlist-verified.
This section covers only J2's mechanical switch and its host input, not
the card power supply, CMD/DAT/CLK interface or complete microSD acceptance.
The saved local circuit has exactly J2.MP2, R72.2, R73.1 and D6.1 on one
contact node; R72.1 on +3V3_MCU; and exactly R73.2 plus U1.F14 on the
end-to-end SD_CD_N net through the microSD and MCU hierarchy ports. D6.2,
J2.6 and MP1/MP3/MP4/MP5/MP6 are GND. Four unique ground symbols remain,
with no duplicated wire segments. Card VDD and all six bus signals remain
open at this stage. All four embedded MCU symbol caches match the library's
289-pin map: only P406/F14 changed from Passive to Input relative to the
preceding checkpoint; other pin identities, alternate definitions, geometry
and placed U1 fields were retained. The 210 preceding component references
retain all 312 original net partitions after excluding the four new parts
J2/R72/R73/D6. These checks establish CD connectivity, not complete ERC
acceptance or card power/bus completion.

```text
+3V3_MCU -- R72 10k --+-- J2.MP2 (CD_B)
                     +-- D6.1 (IO); D6.2 -- GND
                     +-- R73 1k -- SD_CD_N -- U1.P406 / F14 (SD1CD input)
J2.MP4 (CD_A) -- GND
J2.6 (VSS), MP1/MP3/MP5/MP6 (four shields) -- GND
```

R72 is on the **contact side** of R73, unlike the CMS-009 key pullups.
There is no 1k/10k closed-state divider. No capacitor is placed on SD_CD_N:
the initially considered C102=100nF is omitted entirely, not a DNP part.
Neither detect contact is connected to card VDD or a card signal. J2.2 is
DAT3, not this mechanical CD contact. The separate switched card supply
and protected/isolated bus remain incomplete and must not be bypassed by
connecting them to the main host rail.

### Exact reusable parts and primary limits

These are unreserved historical observations, not current order guarantees.

Primary evidence:

- [Hirose EDC-325165-00-00 drawing][cms12-hrs-drawing], sheet 1 of 6,
  revision mark 4 dated 2024-09-02, note 2: A/B open without a card and
  closed with a card. [DM3 catalog D49662_en][cms12-hrs-catalog], printed
  edition 2017.1, retrieved with August 2026 watermark, page 2: 100mOhm
  initial contact resistance tested at **1mA**, with maximum 40mOhm change
  after listed environmental/durability tests; DM3AT durability 10,000 cycles;
  operating -25..85C. The series 0.5A/125VAC ratings are not evidence of a
  minimum CD wetting current or permission to hot-switch that load.
- [RA8P1 datasheet R01DS0439EJ0130][nor-ra-ds], Rev.1.30, 2026-02-27,
  Tables 2.1/2.4/2.5/2.7, pages 44/46-49/57: P406 is not 5V-tolerant,
  ordinary-port off-state leakage is at most 1uA at the stated rail-endpoint
  tests, and its input capacitance category is 8pF maximum **at 25C**.
  The SD_B ch1 peripheral threshold row is 0.625*VCC high / 0.25*VCC low;
  GPIO and other VCC Schmitt inputs use 0.8*VCC / 0.2*VCC. This calculation
  deliberately uses the stricter 0.8/0.2 envelope in both configurations;
  it does not infer a separate SD1CD Schmitt-hysteresis guarantee.
- [RA8P1 HUM R01UH1064EJ0130][nor-ra-hum], same revision/date,
  Tables 21.2/21.11 and 48.2: P406 is VCC-powered, SD1CD is input-only.
  Section 48.3.2.1 describes active-low mechanical detection. SD_INFO1
  SDCDMON=1 means the pin is low/card present; 0 means high/absent.
  SD_OPTION.CTOP sets the continuous detection interval in PCLKB cycles.
- [YAGEO 10k][nor-rc10] and [1k exact specifications][cms12-r1]: 1%,
  +/-100ppm/C. The following screen compounds tolerance and TCR over 100C,
  giving R72=9801..10201Ohm and R73=980.1..1020.1Ohm. That calculation
  excursion is not an expansion of the socket's -25..85C operating rating.
- [TI ESD441 SLVSH26C][cms12-tvs], verified 2026-09-12, sections 5.4/5.6:
  recommended IO-to-GND range is 0..5.5V; the revision corrects the earlier
  negative-range claim. No -5.5V steady-state rating is supported.
  Positive 5.5V stand-off specifies <100nA across operating temperature;
  the separate 50nA maximum at 5.5V is a 25C limit. Pin 1 is IO, pin 2
  GND; 1pF is typical at 0V, 1MHz, 30mV peak-to-peak and 25C, with no
  specified maximum. The positive 3.0..3.6V card-detect reasoning and
  0.1uA TVS allocation below remain valid, so its calculations are
  unchanged. Component IEC ratings and typical clamp voltages do not
  establish the residual MCU waveform or qualify negative transients.

### Executable DC and parasitic screen

Use the full host range 3.0..3.6V, not a draft narrowed converter range.
Allocate 1uA MCU +0.1uA TVS +1uA board/socket leakage = 2.1uA. The last
term is a design allowance, not a guaranteed manufacturer maximum; it
includes contamination and open-switch leakage. Conservatively moving all
leakage to the MCU node overstates both high-state loss and low-state rise.
The 0.14Ohm closed-contact value combines Hirose's initial/test-change
numbers, but its applicability at this circuit's lower steady current is a
**qualification assumption**, not a demonstrated wetting guarantee.

from itertools import product

rp = (10000*.99*.99, 10000*1.01*1.01)

Executed results: high minimum 2.97643569V; low maximum
0.002193926586V; correlated high/low margins 0.57643569V /
0.597814643846V. Screened held contact current is 291.984778760..
369.409458219uA. R72 dissipation is below 1.323mW. These are conditional
design bounds, not a claim that Hirose guaranteed contact resistance at
0.292mA. No published minimum CD wetting current or CD-specific maximum
bounce duration was found in the cited documents. Confirm low-current
contact reliability for the service environment, or revise pullup/part
selection with explicit authority; do not silently treat the 1mA resistance
test as either a mandatory minimum or a proven minimum-current guarantee.

For the explicit parasitic budget, tracking time is 0.7528338us; maximum
continuous falling slew is 367193.516V/s (a 3.6V constant-slope fall takes
at least 9.804095us). This is a bounded circuit screen, not a measured
all-temperature capacitance or guaranteed arbitrary-rail-collapse result.
Verify actual parasitics and local host-rail slew, including fault/brownout
and hard-off, before claiming Vin <= VCC+0.3 under all conditions. Ideal
steps, ESD events and unbounded parasitics are outside this ramp calculation.

The rejected 100nF-at-MCU version would retain energy directly on P406;
an upstream series resistor would not limit that capacitor's current into
the MCU input. With 126.558nF screened total capacitance and the original
2.2uA leakage allowance, its equivalent conservative falling-slew limit
was only 193.866V/s (18.57ms for a full 3.6V linear fall). The existing
loaded hard-off circuit does not establish that restriction. Therefore no
C102 is placed, and no internal clamp-current allowance is assumed.

### Defaults, firmware contract and remaining qualification

With a valid settled host rail, no card means high/absent and an inserted
card means low/present; the mechanical state is independent of card VDD.
Keep P406 input-only, with internal pulls disabled during GPIO and SD1CD
use. Those internal pull currents span 10..300uA and are not part of the
external-resistor calculation. Reset/high-impedance GPIO does not remove
the external default. When the host rail is off, detection is not a valid
logic indication and must not be used to infer a powered card interface.

There is **no intentional analog debounce**. Require at least 20ms of
continuously stable state before accepting insertion/removal or the initial
post-reset state; this is a design policy, not a Hirose bounce guarantee.
Use SD_OPTION.CTOP and/or software so the interval remains >=20ms at the
actual fastest PCLKB, including clock changes. HUM 48.2.16 defines CTOP
0x0..0xE as 2^10..2^24 cycles; 0xF is prohibited. Do not rewrite it while
SD_INFO2.CBSY=1. On reset or wake, resample/debounce instead of assuming
that a new insertion edge will occur for an already inserted card. Firmware
debounce, power sequencing and removal-safe storage handling are requirements,
not implemented changes in this schematic stage.

D6 remains at the socket-side node with a short ground-current return.
Its stand-off rating does not mean it clamps to 3.3V; qualify residual
voltage at P406, R73 pulse stress, enclosure/contact ESD and PCB cleanliness.
Do not claim overall ERC acceptance, microSD operation, card-power isolation,
firmware correctness or full-system qualification from this CD-only screen.

sheet with EN/UV tied to IN and OUTS tied to OUT. IN, EN/UV and PGFB
connect to +3V3_MCU; ILIM and both ground contacts connect to GND, and
PG has an explicit no-connect. C108 and C109 provide the selected 22uF
input/output bypasses. C110 is the selected 100nF C0G SET-to-GND
capacitor. These connections have passed focused exported-netlist checks;
the pre-existing net partitions were preserved after adding the bypasses.
R94 is the selected 1k permanent output load, connected across OUT and
GND. Focused checks confirm its exact net membership and corrected part
metadata, and all 330 preceding microSD net partitions remain intact after
excluding the newly added MIPI components. R95 is the selected 18k,
0.1%, 25ppm/C SET resistor, connected in parallel with C110. Its exact
SET/GND membership, MPN, distributor SKU and sourcing metadata have
passed focused checks; all 330 baseline net partitions remain preserved.
The output is named +1V8_MIPI, with exact exported membership
U23.9, U23.10, C109.1, R94.2, U1.R2 and C111.1. C111.2 connects to
GND. At this supply checkpoint the MCU VCC18_MIPI no-connect was removed,
while the six camera-lane no-connects remained. CMS-015 records their
later replacement by CSI input ports. Independent read-only review confirmed this connection
and preservation of all 329 other baseline net partitions after excluding
new components and the intentional R2 join. This section does not establish camera power,
interface operation or rail-sequencing closure. The refreshed native BOM
contains 19 columns, 98 groups and 256 included references. The full
12-page PDF includes the MCU bypass and both native CMS-013 calculation
notes. All pages received independent visual review; its C111/USB-001
overlap finding was corrected in the native editor. SD-003 now explicitly
identifies its pre-MIPI subtotal and the added 20mA branch. Independent
review passed both visual corrections and C111 metadata. Full BOM-to-netlist
identity, quantities, values and MPN checks pass; only TP1-TP3 are excluded.
CMS-013 and clock Python checks, version and whitespace checks pass.
The ASCII check retains its pre-existing 63-character failure in unchanged
PARTS-CHECKLIST.md. These are bounded implementation checks, not complete
schematic or hardware acceptance.
Native ERC and the exported all-severity report both retain 125 findings
(123 errors, two warnings). Comparison by sheet, severity, violation type
and item identity found no additions or removals against the microSD
checkpoint. This is preservation of the existing backlog, not ERC closure.

The RA8P1 datasheet R01DS0439EJ0130, Table 2.2, specifies 1.65..1.95V for
VCC18_MIPI. Table 2.44 specifies a minimum rise gradient of 8.4us/V for
both MIPI supplies. Table 2.39 lists CSI high-speed VCC18_MIPI current up
to 4.1mA at 105C, two lanes and 720Mbps; this is not a startup-current limit.
Use the official [RA8P1 datasheet][cms13-ra] and retain the selected MCU's
temperature grade. AVCC_MIPI remains a separate 3.3V supply requirement.
The RA8P1 Quick Design Guide Rev. 1.10, Table 1, additionally requires
a local 100nF bypass between MCU R2 and VSS_MIPI. The regulator's SET
capacitor does not provide this supply bypass.

C111 implements that local bypass using TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA,
100nF, +/-10%, 50V X7R. Its native description and selection basis identify
R2 and QDG Table 1. Installed capacitance and PDN qualification remain
open. Its explicitly historical September 5 sourcing snapshot is retained
from the existing TDK selection; availability must be rechecked before
purchase. This is separate from C110, the regulator SET capacitor.

The proposed LT3042 connection follows [ADI Rev. C][cms13-adi]: IN pins
1/2 and EN/UV pin 3 follow the main rail; PGFB pin 6 connects to IN to
disable fast start. PG pin 4 is unused. OUTS pin 9 connects to OUT pin 10;
GND pin 8 and exposed pad 11 connect to ground. Grounded ILIM pin 5
retains internal current limiting, not a small branch-current allocation.
SET pin 7 uses a resistor and capacitor to ground. Output capacitance
must remain at least 4.7uF effective. Reverse-output protection supports
retained output during input collapse; PGFB tied to IN does not preserve
negative-input protection. Do not claim complete board reverse protection.

Proposed passive selections, verified at DigiKey on 2026-09-12:

| Function | Exact MPN | Stock | USD 1 / 10 / 100 |
|---|---|---:|---|
| SET resistor, 18k, 0.1%, 25ppm/C | [RT0603BRD0718KL][cms13-rset-stock] | 45,015 | 0.10 / 0.067 / 0.0559 |

All four distributor listings indicated Active. Primary specifications:
[YAGEO SET resistor][cms13-rset], [YAGEO bleed resistor][cms13-bleed],
[Murata SET capacitor][cms13-cset] and [Samsung input/output capacitor][cms13-cio].
These parts are now present in the native regulator circuit as R95, R94,
C110 and C108/C109 respectively, and are included in the refreshed BOM.

The Samsung part is an existing native donor. Its conditional effective
capacitance screen is 22uF * 0.8 initial tolerance * 0.85 temperature *
0.6 residual retention = 8.976uF per part, exceeding 4.7uF. The remaining
bias/aging/etc. retention must be at least 31.4172% after initial tolerance
and temperature. The 60% allocation requires verification; manufacturer
typical curves do not guarantee this combined installed-part bound. One
10uF, 10% donor under the same screen gives only 4.59uF and is insufficient.

The following tolerance screen uses a 100C resistor excursion and a
100nA combined SET leakage allocation. ADI's 98..102uA SET-current and
2mV offset limits apply under specified settled operating conditions,
including 2V < VIN < 20V and at least 1mA load. The bleed satisfies that
load condition at
the minimum operating rail. These limits do not bound initial startup.

```python
rmin = 18000 * .999 * (1 - 25e-6 * 100)
rmax = 18000 * 1.001 * (1 + 25e-6 * 100)
vmin = (98e-6 - 100e-9) * rmin - .002
vmax = (102e-6 + 100e-9) * rmax + .002
bleed_min = 1.65 / (1000 * 1.01 * 1.01)
assert 1.65 < vmin < vmax < 1.95
assert bleed_min > 1e-3
print('CMS-013 modeled DC V / minimum bleed A', vmin, vmax, bleed_min)

# Conditional SET charging model; not an instantaneous OUT-slew guarantee.
cmin = 100e-9 * .95 * (1 - 30e-6 * 100)
set_slope = (102e-6 + 100e-9) / cmin / 1e6
assert set_slope < 1 / 8.4
print('conditional CSET minimum F / SET slope V/us', cmin, set_slope)

cio_min = 22e-6 * .8 * .85 * .6
required_retention = 4.7e-6 / (22e-6 * .8 * .85)
assert cio_min > 4.7e-6
print('conditional input/output C minimum F / retention floor',
      cio_min, required_retention)

# Separate no-bias cold endpoint screen; not a combined lifetime bound.
cold_min = 100e-9 * .95 * (1 - .0024)
cold_max = 100e-9 * 1.05 * (1 + .0058)
assert cold_min > cmin
print('CSET -55C endpoint minimum / maximum F', cold_min, cold_max)
```

Executed results: 1.754036706..1.846236894V, minimum bleed 1.617488482mA,
conditional CSET minimum 94.715nF and SET slope 0.001077971V/us.
The slope calculation is a charging model, not guaranteed OUT behavior.
Murata's coefficient explicitly covers 25..125C. Its Jan. 10, 2025 reference
sheet, Table A on page 6, separately specifies cold-endpoint changes:
-55C -0.24..+0.58%, -30C -0.17..+0.40%, and -10C -0.11..+0.25%.
With initial tolerance, the -55C endpoint is 94.772..105.609nF. Page 3
specifies no bias, five minutes per temperature stage and less than 1Vrms
measurement; separate drift and environmental allowances remain. Do not
call these endpoint tests an arbitrary combined lifetime bound. Resolve
actual output startup/restart behavior, effective output capacitance,
rail discharge and MCU supply sequencing before claiming acceptance.
The 100nA leakage allowance requires implementation evidence. Account for
regulator quiescent current and permanent bleed in the system power budget.

### Steady CSI branch allocation

Allocate 20mA additional +3V3_MCU current for U23 and its loads. This
raises the [SD-003 subtotal](microsd_power_interface.md#sd-003-main-rail-budget-and-reproducible-screens)
from 2.075A to 2.095A. The 2.090A alternative applies only after the
existing 5mA radio-support overlap is established. These are planning
allocations, not complete system maxima or startup-current bounds.

[ADI Rev. C][cms13-adi] specifies full-temperature ground-current maxima
of 3.5mA at 1mA load, 5mA at 50mA, 7mA at 100mA and 13mA at 200mA.
Note 6 identifies dropout, VIN = VOUT, as the worst ground-current
condition; the ground-current figure excludes SET and ILIM currents.
Use 13mA as a deliberately conservative engineering allocation here,
not as a newly guaranteed interpolated row at the approximately 6mA load.
Allocate another 100uA for auxiliary currents, including ILIM, EN/UV,
PGFB and leakage. This allowance requires verification: the nominal ILIM
ratio and typical PGFB current do not prove a combined maximum.

The [RA8P1 Table 2.39][cms13-ra] CSI HS condition uses at most 4.0mA
VCC18_MIPI current at 95C, two lanes and 720Mbps. The screen below uses
4.1mA from the 105C row conservatively, without expanding the selected
MCU's temperature grade. AVCC_MIPI current remains within the existing
750mA MCU allocation; it is not added again. No DSI/all-mode current
claim follows from this CSI screen. Sensor power is still separate.

```python
from math import isclose
bleed_max = 1.95 / (1000 * .99 * .99)
branch_screen = .0041 + bleed_max + .013 + .000102 + .000100
branch_allocation = .020
assert branch_screen < branch_allocation
total = 2.075 + branch_allocation
assert isclose(total, 2.095)
assert isclose(total - .005, 2.090)
vmain_hi = 3.393012496197
source_current = vmain_hi * total / .75 / 3.2
converter_loss = vmain_hi * total * (1/.75 - 1)
assert 2.961 < source_current < 2.962
assert 2.369 < converter_loss < 2.370
print('bleed / branch screen A', bleed_max, branch_screen)
print('main allocation / source screen A / converter loss W',
      total, source_current, converter_loss)
```

Executed screen: 1.989592899mA bleed, 19.291592899mA branch,
2.095A main allocation, 2.961817158A input and 2.369453727W converter
loss at the stated 3.2V input and assumed 75% efficiency. Source support,
inductor/current and thermal acceptance remain open. Charging C108/C109
and downstream capacitance, regulator startup behavior and other loads
are not bounded by this steady-state arithmetic.
