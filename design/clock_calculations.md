## CLK-001: Y1 main oscillator load network

Calculation revision 2, 2026-09-05. Applies to Y1, C35 and C36 on
[RA8P1 clocks, reset and debug](../ereader/mcu_clocks_debug.kicad_sch)
(sheet 5 of the current [complete schematic export](../exports/ereader_rev1.pdf)).
The schematic annotation carries the same stable identifier, CLK-001, and
links back to this document. Reference designators, not page numbers alone,
identify the circuit. Tracking: [issue #824](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/824).

Status: arithmetic checked; initial component selection only. PCB parasitics,
oscillation margin, frequency, drive level and startup time are NOT measured.
Python verifies the stated model and arithmetic, not physical operation.

### Equivalent circuit and derivation

The crystal connects between OSC_EXTAL and OSC_XTAL. C35 connects EXTAL to
ground and C36 connects XTAL to ground. Looking between the crystal terminals,
these two external capacitors form a series path through ground:

```text
1/Cseries = 1/C35 + 1/C36
Cseries = C35*C36/(C35+C36)
CL_model = Cseries + Cstray_effective
```

This is a lumped first-order model. A more explicit model, following [3]
section 5.4 / Figure 5.4.1, separates each node's shunt capacitance from the
direct terminal-to-terminal capacitance:

```text
A = C35 + C_EXTAL_to_ground
B = C36 + C_XTAL_to_ground
CL_model = A*B/(A+B) + C_between_terminals
```

Pin, package and board capacitances contribute to those parasitic terms.
Do not simply add all pin-to-ground capacitances to CL, or count them both
explicitly and again in Cstray_effective. The lumped 2 pF assumption absorbs
their effective contribution at this proposed operating point. It is not the
crystal's internal shunt capacitance C0. Changing the capacitor values or PCB
can change the equivalent stray contribution.

For equal external capacitors C35 = C36 = C:

```text
CL = C*C/(C+C) + Cstray = C/2 + Cstray
C = 2*(CL - Cstray)
  = 2*(6 pF - 2 pF)
  = 8 pF

Back-substitution:
CL = (8 pF * 8 pF)/(8 pF + 8 pF) + 2 pF
   = 4 pF + 2 pF
   = 6 pF
```

This is why this particular 6 pF crystal has 8 pF external capacitors.
The Renesas 8/8 pF example corroborates an initial matching choice; it does
not measure 2 pF parasitics on this design or qualify this Murata part on it.
The simplified generic example in [3] uses 1 pF pin-to-pin capacitance and
zero board parasitics; substituting that assumption instead would give
2*(6-1) = 10 pF. Neither assumption replaces actual-board matching.

### Crystal substitution and rematching

The schematic's instruction to recalculate and rematch applies even when a
replacement crystal has the same nominal frequency and package. Before
substituting Y1 (or Y2 under CLK-002):

1. Check the exact ordering suffix for specified CL, maximum ESR, maximum
   drive, frequency tolerance, temperature range and terminal connections.
2. Recalculate the external capacitors using that crystal's CL and the
   relevant oscillator circuit's effective parasitic model. Do not carry
   the main oscillator's parasitic assumption into the RTC circuit.
3. Update the schematic, BOM and this record together, then run the Python
   checker with the revised inputs and expected results.
4. Repeat actual-board frequency, startup, drive and oscillation-margin
   qualification. Equal CL does not establish equivalent ESR or drive limits.

For example, a hypothetical 8 pF-load crystal at the same assumed 2 pF
effective stray would require C = 2*(8-2) = 12 pF, not the fitted 8 pF.
This is a sensitivity example, not an approved alternate part.

### Capacitor tolerance and sensitivity

At fixed assumed Cstray = 2 pF, each selected capacitor ranges from
8-0.5 = 7.5 pF to 8+0.5 = 8.5 pF. Series capacitance increases monotonically
with either positive capacitance, so the joint minimum and maximum are:

```text
CL_min = 7.5*7.5/(7.5+7.5) + 2 = 5.75 pF
CL_max = 8.5*8.5/(8.5+8.5) + 2 = 6.25 pF
Load deviation = +/-0.25/6 * 100 = +/-4.166667 percent
Opposite tolerance corners = 7.5*8.5/(7.5+8.5) + 2 = 5.984375 pF
```

This range includes initial capacitor tolerance only. It excludes unknown
parasitic error, temperature effects and measurement loading. It is NOT a
frequency-tolerance result: load pulling requires the crystal's motional
parameters or measured pulling curve. Do not convert +/-4.166667 percent
load error into the same percentage or ppm frequency error.

Sensitivity examples below are assumed scenarios, NOT characterized bounds:

| Effective stray (pF) | Required equal C for CL 6 pF (pF) | CL with fitted 8/8 pF (pF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 10.0 | 5.0 |
| 1.5 | 9.0 | 5.5 |
| 2.0 | 8.0 | 6.0 |
| 2.5 | 7.0 | 6.5 |
| 3.0 | 6.0 | 7.0 |

### ESR screening and hardware release conditions

The group-10 reference board has negative resistance -1050 ohm at this
example setting and an ESR recommendation of 210 ohm [3]. The arithmetic
1050/5 = 210 explains its fivefold screening margin. Y1's specified maximum
ESR of 100 ohm is below 210 ohm; reference ratio 1050/100 = 10.5.
That is a comparison with another board, NOT a measured margin for ours.
No external damping or feedback resistor is fitted in the initial network.

Before hardware release, qualify the actual MCU setting, startup wait,
frequency over supply/temperature, negative-resistance margin and excitation
power following [3] sections 5-6 and the MCU electrical requirements. The
24 MHz example uses the 8-to-24-MHz drive setting; its suitability still
needs confirmation on the finished circuit. Crystal drive must remain at
or below 300 uW. Do not derive actual drive from supply voltage or apply
the full MCU output swing across the crystal ESR. Measurement loading must
be controlled. Any load-value change requires recalculation, schematic/BOM
update and repeated matching. RTC calculations are recorded as CLK-002 below.

### Reproducible arithmetic verification

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 ra8p1_kicad/scripts/check_clock_calculations.py
```

The [read-only checker](../scripts/check_clock_calculations.py) uses exact
rational arithmetic, verifies nominal, tolerance corners, sensitivity and
reference ESR ratios, and checks C35/C36/Y1 values against the exported BOM.
It does not modify the schematic, choose parts or claim electrical sign-off.
Expected output includes separate CLK-001 and CLK-002 PASS messages.

## CLK-002: Y2 RTC oscillator load network

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to Y2/C37/C38 on the same
[clock schematic](../ereader/mcu_clocks_debug.kicad_sch), annotation CLK-002.
Status: initial matching circuit; hardware qualification remains required.

### Exact parts and connection

Y2 is Abracon ABS07-LR-32.768KHZ-6-1-T. The ordering suffix selects 6 pF
load, +/-10 ppm initial tolerance and tape packaging. The LR series specifies
50 kohm maximum ESR at +25 C, 0.5 uW maximum drive (0.1 uW typical), and
-40 to +85 C operation. These are not measurements of this circuit.
The previously imported ABS07-32.768KHZ-1-T has different load and ESR
specifications and is not interchangeable without rematching.

C37/C38 are TDK C1005NP01H040C050BA, each 4 pF +/-0.25 pF, 50 V NP0.
The tighter-tolerance C1005C0G1H040B050BA candidate was rejected because
TDK marks it not recommended for new designs. The selected NP0 variant
is listed in production. These specifications come from the exact
[TDK product record](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C1005NP01H040C050BA).

RTC_XCIN connects U1.L17, Y2.1 and C37.1. RTC_XCOUT connects U1.L16,
Y2.2 and C38.1. Both capacitor pin 2 terminals connect to GND. No external
feedback or damping resistor is fitted in this initial network.

### Load calculation and uncertainty

Using the same lumped model and limitations as CLK-001, but a DIFFERENT
unmeasured effective stray assumption for the sub-clock circuit:

```text
CL_target = 6 pF (selected crystal)
Cstray_effective = 4 pF (ASSUMED, not a pin specification)
C37 = C38 = C = 2*(CL_target - Cstray_effective)
              = 2*(6-4) = 4 pF
CL_check = 4*4/(4+4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 pF
```

The 4/4 pF starting network follows the group-10 sub-clock matching example
in Renesas R01AN7202EJ0102 Table 4.2.10, p.25. The implied 4 pF effective
stray is a model assumption inferred from that example, not independently
established on this PCB. The main-clock circuit's 2 pF assumption does not
automatically apply to the different RTC amplifier/pins. Actual matching
may require changing these values. Do not count crystal C0 as board stray.

At fixed 4 pF effective stray, initial capacitor tolerance gives:

```text
C_low = 4-0.25 = 3.75 pF; C_high = 4+0.25 = 4.25 pF
CL_min = 3.75*3.75/(3.75+3.75)+4 = 5.875 pF
CL_max = 4.25*4.25/(4.25+4.25)+4 = 6.125 pF
Opposite corners = 3.75*4.25/(3.75+4.25)+4 = 5.9921875 pF
Relative load deviation = +/-0.125/6*100 = +/-2.083333 percent
```

Sensitivity, with the installed capacitors held at nominal 4/4 pF:

| Assumed stray (pF) | Required equal C for CL 6 pF (pF) | CL with 4/4 pF (pF) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 8 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 | 5 |
| 4 | 4 | 6 |
| 5 | 2 | 7 |

These are scenarios, not a guaranteed parasitic range. Load error is not
frequency error. Y2's +/-10 ppm initial tolerance corresponds to
32768*10/1000000 = +/-0.32768 Hz, or +/-0.864 seconds/day at its specified
test conditions; it excludes load mismatch, temperature and aging.
The series specifies a parabolic temperature coefficient and +/-3 ppm
first-year aging, so this is not an all-temperature clock accuracy claim.

### Drive-mode basis and release requirements

Initial setting: SOMCR.SODRV[1:0] = 10b (low-power mode 2), SOSEL = 0
(resonator). HUM Rev.1.30 section 9.2.29, p.352, requires changing SOMCR
only with SOSCCR.SOSTP = 1 and the applicable write protection unlocked.
SOMCR resets only on VBATT_POR; an ordinary reset is not sufficient to
assume its default state. This document defines an electrical integration
requirement, not a firmware implementation.

The group-10 reference board's low-power-mode-2 negative resistance is
-600 kohm with a 120 kohm recommended maximum ESR. Reference screening:
600/5 = 120 kohm; 600/50 = 12 times Y2's +25 C ESR maximum. The lowest
drive mode has a recommended ceiling of only 50 kohm, equal to this
crystal's room-temperature maximum; it is not selected on that basis.
Neither comparison guarantees margin across temperature or on this PCB.
Measure startup and negative resistance, including supply/temperature
extremes, and verify crystal drive <=0.5 uW before release. Increasing
drive can improve startup while violating crystal excitation limits.

Determine the stabilization wait from actual oscillator evaluation per
RA8P1 datasheet Table 2.51 and HUM section 9.4. Do not substitute an
arbitrary fixed delay or assume this calculation measures startup time.
Measure frequency through a buffered clock output; direct probing changes
the small resonator load. No oscillator-node test point is added.
