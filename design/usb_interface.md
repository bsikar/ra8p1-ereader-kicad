# RA8P1 USB electrical design

USB-001..004 record the installed PHY reference and supply components.
[USB-005](#usb-005-wet-port-and-dual-role-controller-candidate-review)
records the replacement architecture investigation required by the current
water-resistance and USB2 device/host/USB-DAC requirements. No connector,
moisture controller or replacement power-path circuit is selected by that
review.

## USB-001: R6 reference resistor

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to U1.J15 and R6 on
[the MCU interface sheet](../ereader/mcu_interfaces.kicad_sch), page 2 of
[the full schematic PDF](../exports/ereader_rev1.pdf). The on-sheet USB-001
annotation links back to this section. Tracking: [#824](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/824).

### Requirement and selected component

The [Renesas RA8x2 Quick Design Guide](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/ra8p1-mcu-quick-design-guide),
R01AN7883EU0110 Rev.1.10, Table 2, p.7 specifies a 2.2 kohm +/-1%
resistor from USBHS_RREF to VSS1_USBHS/VSS2_USBHS. This reference sets
the PHY's internal current reference; it is not a USB data termination.
The value is a manufacturer requirement, not a result of dividing the
3.3 V supply by a desired current.

R6 is YAGEO RC0603FR-072K2L: 2.2 kohm +/-1%, 0603, 0.1 W at 70 C,
TCR +/-100 ppm/C, rated component temperature -55 to +155 C.
See the [exact manufacturer specification](https://yageogroup.com/component-documentation/download/specsheet/RC0603FR-072K2L).
The component temperature rating does not establish the product's operating
range. Footprint qualification remains deferred.

U1.J15 and R6.1 share the sheet-local USBHS_RREF net. R6.2 connects to
GND, shared with U1.J16 and U1.J17. Keep the physical resistor close to
the reference pin with a short, quiet ground return during later PCB work.

### Calculation and limits

```text
Rnom = 2200 ohm
t = 1/100 = 0.01
DeltaR = Rnom*t = 2200*0.01 = 22 ohm
Rmin = Rnom*(1-t) = 2200*0.99 = 2178 ohm
Rmax = Rnom*(1+t) = 2200*1.01 = 2222 ohm
```

These are initial resistance-tolerance bounds only. They do not include
temperature drift, aging, or soldering shifts. TCR contributes approximately
`100e-6*abs(T-Tref)` fractional change at its specified maximum magnitude;
do not label the initial +/-1% range as an all-temperature guarantee.

The documents above do not establish the operating voltage across R6.
Consequently this record does not invent a PHY reference current or resistor
dissipation using `3.3 V / 2200 ohm`. Physical operation and temperature
qualification remain unverified.

### Reproduce the Python arithmetic check

Run from the repository root. The check is read-only and also checks the
native KiCad BOM export against the selected reference and part number:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
import csv
from fractions import Fraction
from pathlib import Path

r = Fraction(2200)
t = Fraction(1, 100)
actual = (r*t, r*(1-t), r*(1+t))
if actual != (22, 2178, 2222):
    raise ValueError('USB-001 arithmetic mismatch')
with Path('ra8p1_kicad/exports/ereader_rev1_bom.csv').open(newline='') as stream:
    rows = list(csv.DictReader(stream))
row = next(item for item in rows if item['Reference'] == 'R6')
if row['Value'] != '2.2k 1%' or row['Manufacturer_Part_Number'] != 'RC0603FR-072K2L':
    raise ValueError('USB-001 BOM mismatch')
print('USB-001 PASS: +/-22 ohm; 2178..2222 ohm; exact BOM part agrees.')
PY
```

## USB-002: Full-speed supply bypass

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to U1.U17 (VCC_USB), U1.T17 (VSS_USB)
and C40 on the MCU interface sheet. The USB-002 annotation links here.
Renesas R01AN7883EU0110 Table 1, p.6 requires VCC_USB connected to the
3.3 V system supply and bypassed to VSS_USB with a nearby 100 nF capacitor.

Standard +3V3_MCU power symbols connect U1.U17 and the bypass block to the
same global rail, without a second local name or a separate regulated or
filtered rail. C40.1 is on that supply; C40.2 and U1.T17 are on GND.
Place C40 physically close to the supply pin with a short ground return
when the PCB is designed. Separation on this schematic does not prescribe
physical separation. Do not add a PWR_FLAG to conceal the unfinished source
regulator: this bypass is not a power source.

C40 is TDK C1608X7R1H104K080AA, 100 nF +/-10%, 50 V X7R, the same
screened part as the other 3.3 V bypasses. Manufacturer curve provenance,
temperature/aging limitations and nominal DC-bias interpolation are in
[PWR-001](power_decoupling.md#nominal-dc-bias-screening-and-shared-bypass-selection).

```text
C_initial_min = 100*(1-0.10) = 90 nF
C_initial_max = 100*(1+0.10) = 110 nF
C_nominal(3.3 V) = 99.5575 + (3.3-3.15)/0.85*(-0.605)
                 = 99.450735... nF
```

These are respectively initial tolerance bounds and a nominal reference
estimate, not a guaranteed all-corners operating capacitance. Final supply
regulation, USB data routing/connector/protection and the high-speed analog
filter remain separate unfinished requirements. USB-003 below records the
high-speed digital supply capacitors.

Run this read-only check from the repository root:

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
import csv
from fractions import Fraction as F

with open('ra8p1_kicad/exports/ereader_rev1_bom.csv', newline='') as stream:
    rows = [r for r in csv.DictReader(stream) if 'C40' in r['Reference'].split(',')]
if len(rows) != 1:
    raise ValueError('C40 must occur exactly once')
row = rows[0]
if (row['Value'], row['Manufacturer_Part_Number'], row['DNP']) != (
        '100n', 'C1608X7R1H104K080AA', ''):
    raise ValueError('C40 BOM inputs differ from calculation')
actual = (100*(1-F('0.10')), 100*(1+F('0.10')),
          F('99.5575')+(F('3.3')-F('3.15'))/F('0.85')*F('-0.605'))
if actual != (90, 110, F(676265, 6800)):
    raise ValueError('USB-002 arithmetic mismatch')
print('USB-002 PASS: 90..110 nF initial; 99.450735 nF nominal at 3.3 V.')
PY
```

## USB-003: High-speed digital supply bypass and bulk capacitance

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to C41/C42 and U1.H15 (VCC_USBHS) on
[the MCU interface sheet](../ereader/mcu_interfaces.kicad_sch). The USB-003
schematic annotation links here. Tracking: [#824](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/824).

### Requirement and circuit

[Renesas RA8x2 Quick Design Guide](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/ra8p1-mcu-quick-design-guide),
R01AN7883EU0110 revision 1.10, Table 1 p.6, specifies VCC_USBHS connected
to the 3.3 V system supply, a nearby 10 nF ceramic capacitor, and a 47 uF
electrolytic capacitor, both returning to VSS1_USBHS/VSS2_USBHS.
These are manufacturer-prescribed nominal values, not capacitances derived
from an assumed USB current. The ceramic and electrolytic serve different
frequency ranges; adding their nameplate capacitances does not replace
either requirement.

U1.H15, C41.1 and C42.1 connect to +3V3_MCU. C41.2, C42.2, U1.J17
(VSS1_USBHS) and U1.J16 (VSS2_USBHS) connect to GND. C42 is polarized:
positive terminal to the supply, negative terminal to ground. No PWR_FLAG
is added: capacitors cannot qualify the unfinished regulator as a source.
The separate AVCC_USBHS filtered supply is documented under USB-004 below.

### Exact parts and initial tolerance

C41: [TDK C1608X7R1H103K080AA](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C1608X7R1H103K080AA),
10 nF +/-10%, 50 VDC, X7R (+/-15%), -55 to +125 C, commercial 0603.
TDK lists Production. The exact part's voltage-bias curve is screened below;
the curve for the 100 nF sibling must not be substituted.

C42: [Panasonic EEE-FP0J470AR](https://industrial.panasonic.com/ww/products/pt/aluminum-cap-smd/models/EEEFP0J470AR),
manufacturer's compact spelling EEEFP0J470AR. This is a polarized 47 uF
+/-20%, 6.3 V aluminum electrolytic. The [FP-A catalog](https://industrial.panasonic.com/cdbs/www-data/pdf/RDE0000/ABA0000C1184.pdf),
pp.1 and 3, specifies tolerance at 120 Hz/+20 C, ESR <=0.36 ohm at
100 kHz/+20 C, rated ripple 240 mArms at 100 kHz/+105 C, and 2000-hour
endurance at +105 C. Those test conditions are not an e-reader lifetime
prediction. Its 5 mm diameter and 5.8 mm nominal body length are a later
enclosure constraint; footprint qualification remains out of scope.

```text
C41_min = 10*(1-0.10) = 9 nF
C41_max = 10*(1+0.10) = 11 nF
C42_min = 47*(1-0.20) = 37.6 uF
C42_max = 47*(1+0.20) = 56.4 uF

At nominal rail 3.3 V:
C42 voltage utilization = 3.3/6.3*100 = 52.380952 percent
At a 3.6 V screening ceiling (not a measured regulator output):
C42 voltage utilization = 3.6/6.3*100 = 57.142857 percent
C42 voltage headroom = 6.3-3.6 = 2.7 V
C41 voltage utilization = 3.6/50*100 = 7.2 percent
```

The tolerance intervals are initial component limits, not guaranteed
operating capacitance after temperature, reflow, aging or endurance.
Supply transients must remain within both MCU and capacitor limits, and
C42 must never see reverse voltage. Extra capacitor voltage rating does
not increase the MCU's permissible supply voltage.

### C41 nominal DC-bias screening

The exact TDK product page's DC Bias Characteristic CSV was downloaded in
the browser on 2026-09-05. The [preserved source CSV](../resources/datasheets/TDK_C1608X7R1H103K080AA_dc_bias_2026-09-05.csv)
retains all data rows; only BOM, line endings and trailing blank row are
normalized. TDK labels this reference data, not guaranteed characteristics.

```text
Manufacturer samples: C(3.15 V) = 10.0899 nF; C(4 V) = 10.0570 nF
Linear interpolation, C(V) = Ca + (V-Va)/(Vb-Va)*(Cb-Ca):
C(3.3 V) = 10.0899 + (3.3-3.15)/(4-3.15)*(10.0570-10.0899)
         = 10.084094117647... nF
C(3.6 V) = 10.0899 + (3.6-3.15)/(4-3.15)*(10.0570-10.0899)
         = 10.072482352941... nF
```

This supports the initial low-bias selection, not an all-corners minimum.
Do not claim that the slight nominal increase compensates initial tolerance
or that bias characteristics of other capacitances are interchangeable.

### Remaining electrical qualification

Place C41 close to H15 with a short return to the USB-HS ground pins;
keep C42's supply/return loop compact. Drawing separation is not a physical
placement instruction. Final regulator ramp, rail tolerance, load transients,
capacitor ripple heating and endurance must be checked against the finished
power tree and operating temperature. Ripple current is not the MCU DC load
current. This record does not assume a current step, derive fictitious droop,
or certify USB signal integrity from capacitance values.

## USB-004: High-speed analog supply filter

Revision 1, 2026-09-05. Applies to FB1, C43 and U1.K15 on
[the MCU interface sheet](../ereader/mcu_interfaces.kicad_sch). The USB-004
schematic annotation links to this section. Tracking: [#824](https://github.com/bsikar/ra8-firmware/issues/824).

### Requirement, circuit and exact parts

[Renesas RA8x2 Quick Design Guide](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/ra8p1-mcu-quick-design-guide),
R01AN7883EU0110 revision 1.10, Table 2 p.7, prescribes an isolation
inductor/ferrite between the 3.3 V system supply and AVCC_USBHS, with
10 uF bypass to VSS1_USBHS/VSS2_USBHS. The 10 uF nominal capacitance
is a manufacturer requirement, not a value derived from an invented load step.

FB1 separates +3V3_MCU from +3V3_USBHS_A. The latter connects C43.1 and
U1.K15 (AVCC_USBHS). C43.2 returns to GND, common with U1.J17 and U1.J16.
No PWR_FLAG declares the still-unimplemented regulator a valid source.

FB1 is Murata BLM18PG121SN1D: 120 ohm +/-25% impedance at 100 MHz,
0.05 ohm maximum initial DC resistance, 2 A rated at 85 C ambient and
1 A at 125 C. The [Murata reference specification](https://pim.murata.com/asset/pim4/ferriteBeadInductortypefilter/ENFA0003_PDF_FERRITEBEADINDUCTORTYPEFILTER),
JENF243A_0003AN-01 p.1, separately gives 0.10 ohm maximum after testing.
That after-test limit is not asserted to be a guaranteed hot DCR at every
operating temperature. Final thermal and transient qualification remains open.

C43 is [TDK C3216X7R1V106K160AC](https://product.tdk.com/en/search/capacitor/ceramic/mlcc/info?part_no=C3216X7R1V106K160AC),
10 uF +/-10%, 35 VDC, X7R (+/-15%), -55 to +125 C, commercial 1206,
listed Production. Initial tolerance alone gives 10*(1 +/-0.10) = 9..11 uF.
Voltage utilization at the MCU's 3.60 V active-supply maximum is
3.60/35*100 = 10.285714 percent. This does not guarantee effective capacitance.

### DC voltage-drop and dissipation screening

The [RA8P1 datasheet](https://www.renesas.com/en/document/dst/ra8p1-group-datasheet),
revision 1.30 Table 2.39 p.81, lists combined USB-HS supply current up to
55.3 mA under its specified test conditions, with VCC_USBHS = AVCC_USBHS.
Using the entire combined current for the analog branch is a conservative
steady-state screening assumption under those conditions, not a measured
analog-only current and not an inrush or arbitrary workload bound.

```text
I_screen = 55.3 mA = 0.0553 A
Initial DCR screen:
Vdrop = I*R = 0.0553*0.05 = 0.002765 V = 2.765 mV
P = I^2*R = 0.0553^2*0.05 = 0.0001529045 W = 0.1529045 mW

After-test DCR screen:
Vdrop = 0.0553*0.10 = 0.005530 V = 5.530 mV
P = 0.0553^2*0.10 = 0.000305809 W = 0.305809 mW
Vanalog at ideal 3.3 V source = 3.3-0.00553 = 3.29447 V
Minimum source for 3.00 V analog = 3.00+0.00553 = 3.00553 V
Current utilization of 1 A rating at 125 C = 0.0553/1*100 = 5.53 percent
```

The 3.00553 V result excludes regulator tolerance, other interconnect losses,
temperature-dependent resistance and transients. Both active USB-HS supplies
must meet the datasheet's 3.00..3.60 V operating range. Verify rail ramp,
sequencing and startup against the final power tree; these DC calculations
do not qualify them. Do not calculate an inductance, filter cutoff or noise
attenuation from the single 120 ohm impedance magnitude at 100 MHz.
That requires the bead's complex frequency/bias behavior and the complete
source, load and capacitor impedance network, including resonance/damping.

### Exact capacitor bias data

The [preserved TDK CSV](../resources/datasheets/TDK_C3216X7R1V106K160AC_dc_bias_2026-09-05.csv)
was downloaded through the exact part's browser page on 2026-09-05 and
verified row-for-row against the download. Only BOM, line endings and the
trailing blank row are normalized. TDK explicitly identifies this graph
as reference data, not guaranteed product characteristics.

```text
C(3.15 V) = 9.69875 uF; C(4.00 V) = 9.38950 uF
C(V) = Ca + (V-Va)/(Vb-Va)*(Cb-Ca)
C(3.3 V) = 9.69875 + (3.3-3.15)/0.85*(9.38950-9.69875)
         = 9.644176470588... uF
C(3.6 V) = 9.69875 + (3.6-3.15)/0.85*(9.38950-9.69875)
         = 9.535029411764... uF
```

This is nominal linear interpolation, not a guaranteed lower bound.
Initial tolerance, temperature, aging and AC excitation require separate
consideration. The nominal 10 uF selection follows the guide; no claim is
made that 10 uF minimum remains available across all operating conditions.

### Reproducible arithmetic check

Run from the repository root after exporting the native BOM. This checks
the exact fitted parts, source curve identity and arithmetic, not physical
filter performance.

## USB-005: Wet-port and dual-role controller candidate review

Revision 1, 2026-09-13. **Candidate research only; not a selected circuit,
native implementation, or hardware qualification.** The current
[product requirements](ereader_requirements.md) retain autonomous battery
charging, USB2 device and host operation, and digital USB-DAC support while
requiring hardware inhibition of charging and VBUS sourcing when wet.

The earlier sink-only TUSB320LAIRWBR/TPS2553DRVR proposal in
[SYS-009](system_power_design.md#sys-009-usb-c-budget-configured-500-ma-latch-and-input-switch)
is superseded as an implementation direction for these expanded requirements.
Its conditional current calculations remain historical evidence for that
topology; they do not qualify the new controller, host supply or wet-port
behavior. In particular, the old SYS-008 BQ25616 OTG-to-GND connection cannot
supply a USB peripheral. The [TUSB320LAI datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tusb320lai.pdf)
defines CC attach/current/role detection, not liquid detection, and the
[TPS2553 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps2553.pdf) defines a
current-limited switch, not a moisture discriminator. USB-001..004 remain
applicable PHY design records.

### TPS25751D candidate and primary evidence

[TI TPS25751 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps25751.pdf),
SLVSH93A, March 2024, supports standalone dual-role operation with integrated
sink and 5 V source paths. Section 9.2.2.2 requires external SBU sensing
circuitry and protection against SBU-to-VBUS shorts; section 9.2.2.2.1 says
liquid detection disables power paths. Table 8-6 SafeMode keeps the sink
path off until configuration loads. AlwaysEnableSink instead enables it
before configuration and is unsuitable as the proposed wet-start default.
These features make TPS25751D a candidate, not a complete wet-port proof.

[TPS25751 TRM](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slvucr8), SLVUCR8A, section 3.27,
register 0x98, defaults liquid detection and corrosion mitigation to OFF.
The configuration must enable both. Corrosion mitigation disables the port
and pulls down CC; programmable sample timing, thresholds and exit hysteresis
control detection and recovery. **Dry-before-first-enable ordering remains
unresolved:** SafeMode before configuration does not prove that the first
valid dry measurement precedes sink/source enable after configuration.
Confirm that ordering, missing/corrupt EEPROM behavior and brownout recovery
with the selected configuration/firmware and manufacturer evidence. RA8P1
firmware must not be the sole mechanism preventing wet charging or sourcing.

[TPS25751 EVM guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvucp9b/slvucp9b.pdf),
SLVUCP9B, October 2025, section 4.4 explicitly makes internal BC1.2 and
liquid detection/corrosion mitigation mutually exclusive: both use GPIO4/5.
Its external protection implementation uses TPD4S201; the older controller
datasheet illustrates TPD2S300. Neither reference is an automatic selection
for this board. USB2 data itself can remain on separately protected D+/D-
to the RA8P1. Legacy charger identification needs another implementation or
a conservative permission policy; disabling BC1.2 does not grant additional
input current.

The [TI product documentation](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS25751) lists
autonomous charger integration for BQ25756/BQ25756E, BQ25790/BQ25792,
BQ25798, BQ25713 and BQ25731; it does not list BQ25616. Retaining BQ25616
would require an independently proved power-path/charge-enable/OTG design.
Choosing a supported charger instead reopens battery settings, source
current, thermal and input-permission calculations. Neither choice is made
here, and no current stock or exact orderable-package selection is asserted.

### FUSB251UCX companion alternative

[onsemi FUSB251 datasheet](https://www.onsemi.com/download/data-sheet/pdf/fusb251-d.pdf),
pp.9-10, provides CC/SBU protection and moisture measurement, but moisture
detection defaults disabled. Results use registers and an interrupt; after
CC measurement the CC switches close again regardless of moisture presence.
It contains no VBUS power switch. In dead battery, its Rd terminations invite
an external source to apply VBUS. Thus adding FUSB251UCX to TUSB320 alone
does not establish autonomous wet inhibition. A separate always-available
control and fail-safe power-disconnect implementation would be necessary.
This remains an alternative for evaluation, not a fitted or selected part.

### Proposed architecture boundary and unresolved qualification

The engineering direction to evaluate is an independently powered port
controller/configuration island, a normally disabled reverse-blocking sink
path to the charger, and a normally disabled source path from regulated
battery-derived 5 V. Wet/fault permission must inhibit both paths independently
of the application MCU; charger-disable and boost-disable controls are needed
where the final topology could otherwise bypass that inhibition. USB2 data
protection/disconnection and its unpowered behavior need their own circuit.
Digital USB-DAC operation requires USB host/data and a valid peripheral power
budget; it does not require analog audio routing over SBU. Controller power
role alone does not prove RA8P1 USB role switching or audio-class firmware.

Opening local switches does not remove externally supplied VBUS from the
receptacle. A legacy or noncompliant source may keep it energized. The
connector-side protection and sensing island must withstand that condition
and wet cross-pin shorts while isolating internal power/data circuits. A
powered-down detection island cannot be assumed to retain a dry verdict;
dead-battery insertion must return to a safe state and repeat qualification.

SBU sensing is not proof that every contact is dry. Thresholds, detection
latency during attached operation, contamination, recovery delay, temperature,
standby current, source/load transients and wet insertion with a depleted
battery remain unqualified. Connector sealing, enclosure construction and
the environmental test definition are separate requirements; this record
does not establish an ingress-protection rating or corrosion lifetime.
