# ereader_rev1 — Parts Checklist / BOM Tracker

Living candidate inventory, not an approved purchasing list. Library presence does not establish electrical suitability, availability, or footprint qualification. Parts live in shared functional libraries under `libs/symbols/`, `libs/footprints/`, and `libs/3dmodels/`; see `LIBRARY_STANDARDS.md`.

## Schematic-linked BOM and sourcing policy

The current placed-parts BOM is [exports/ereader_rev1_bom.csv](exports/ereader_rev1_bom.csv), exported through KiCad's Symbol Fields Table for the entire project. It includes all physical components, including capacitors, resistors, and switches. Unplaced library candidates below are not included in its quantities. The incomplete schematic is not ready to order.

Maintain manufacturer, exact ordering MPN, DigiKey and/or Mouser part number/link, procurement status, and dated supplier-specific stock/price snapshots in the schematic fields as each section is designed. Both distributors are in scope. Compare sources before flagging a part for replacement; one distributor's discontinuation is not manufacturer EOL. Export the CSV after changes using Tools > Generate Bill of Materials, entire project, with the procurement fields included. Output is `../exports/ereader_rev1_bom.csv` relative to the schematic directory. Do not hand-edit quantities in the generated CSV.

Prefer active parts with substantial distributor-held stock, reasonable prototype and volume pricing, and adequate electrical margins. Record packaging and price breaks; do not confuse reel pricing with cut tape or marketplace stock with DigiKey inventory. Indexed stock is a dated indication, not a reservation or checkout verification. Recheck before ordering. Qualify voltage/current/temperature ratings, capacitor DC bias, regulator stability, oscillator matching, and interface compatibility before approving a selection. PCB footprint validation remains deferred.

Initial sourcing review, 2026-09-05:

- **U1 retain exact #UC0; sourcing HOLD removed:** The user's open Mouser search results were inspected directly in Edge on 2026-09-05. [Mouser's exact #UC0 part](https://www.mouser.com/en/ProductDetail/Renesas-Electronics/R7KA8P1KFLCACUC0?qs=2FehpBK1j97Anbj%252BfZIC1A%3D%3D), `968-R7KA8P1KFLCACUC0`, showed 317 in stock, minimum/multiple 1, and USD unit prices 29.47 / 23.82 / 22.75 / 21.71 / 21.70 at quantities 1 / 10 / 25 / 100 / 189. Circuit qualification remains ongoing. [DigiKey's #UC0 listing](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/renesas-electronics-corporation/R7KA8P1KFLCAC-UC0/26738126) still reports discontinued there, one in stock, and no backorders; retain that supplier-specific risk, not a design-wide unavailability claim. No suffix substitution is justified by that listing alone.
- **R1-R5 selected:** [Yageo RC0603FR-0710KL](https://www.yageogroup.com/component-documentation/download/specsheet/RC0603FR-0710KL), 10 kohm 1%, 0603, 100 mW at 70 C. At 3.6 V and the 9.9 kohm tolerance minimum, pull-down current is 0.364 mA and dissipation is 1.31 mW. [DigiKey `311-10.0KHRCT-ND`](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/yageo/RC0603FR-0710KL/729827) indexed stock 2,922,248; active; cut-tape USD unit prices 0.10 / 0.025 / 0.01220 / 0.00661 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100 / 1000. Footprint qualification remains deferred.
- **L1 candidate:** [TDK SPM5020T-2R2M-LR](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tdk/SPM5020T-2R2M-LR/5962361), DigiKey `445-174497-1-ND`, indexed stock 1,149; cut-tape unit prices USD 1.35 / 1.111 / 0.9134 at quantities 1 / 10 / 100. Active, indicated 15-week lead time. Renesas reference recommendation supports selection, but system validation is still pending.
- **Main clock selected for schematic:** Y1 is Murata `XRCGB24M000F3M19R0`, replacing the imported FL2400022 instance. C35/C36 are TDK `C1005NP01H080D050BA`. Exact specifications, initial load calculation, and remaining board-level oscillator matching requirements are in [boot and debug](design/boot_and_debug.md). The BOM carries dated stock/pricing and links for both parts. Do not purchase the old FL2400022 for Y1.
- Remaining placed parts are explicitly marked TBD or HOLD until exact MPN sourcing and electrical qualification are completed. No fabricated total cost is reported while selections are incomplete.

## Notes
- **Power + clock reference:** consult `resources/manuals/Renesas_EK-RA8D2_Board_BOM.xlsx`, but verify regulators, crystals, decoupling and pin compatibility against the exact RA8P1 ordering code. The RA8D2 reference does not guarantee compatibility.
- **Urgent gaps:** power-chain and oscillator qualification, and the display subsystem's exact panel/controller requirements. MCU sourcing is available through Mouser; monitor replenishment for production quantities.
- Every new physical part: qualify its electrical role and DigiKey sourcing, maintain the schematic procurement fields and exported BOM, and import necessary library assets per `LIBRARY_STANDARDS.md`. Checking off a library import is not purchasing approval.
